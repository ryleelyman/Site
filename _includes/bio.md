**NSF Postdoctoral Fellow**  
Department of Mathematics  
[Rutgers University–Newark](https://sasn.rutgers.edu/academics-admissions/academic-departments/mathematics-computer-science)

I like thinking about topics related to outer automorphisms of free groups and
mapping classes of surface diffeomorphisms.
I'm curious about geometric topology, geometric group theory, Teichmüller theory,
tropical geometry, orbifolds, cube complexes, etc.

I earned my PhD in Mathematics from [Tufts University](https://math.tufts.edu),
where my advisor was [Kim Ruane](https://math.tufts.edu/people/faculty/kim-ruane).
I am a postdoc at
[Rutgers University–Newark](https://sasn.rutgers.edu/academics-admissions/academic-departments/mathematics-computer-science).
My mentor at Rutgers is [Lee Mosher](https://www.newark.rutgers.edu/about-us/have-you-met-rutgers-newark/lee-mosher).
In 2024, I will start as an assistant professor at Rutgers--Newark.

My email address is <rylee.lyman@rutgers.edu>.
