In the previous post, we defined *free splittings* for a group $$F$$.
The quotient of a free splitting $$T$$ of $$F$$ by the action of $$F$$
is a *graph of groups with trivial edge groups.*
The purpose of this post is to introduce *maps* of graphs of groups with trivial edge groups
and explore lifting maps of the quotient graph of groups to twisted equivariant maps 
of the tree $$T$$.

## Graphs of groups with trivial edge groups

Let $$G$$ be a finite graph.
The structure of a *graph of groups with trivial edge groups* on $$G$$
is the assignment, for each vertex $$v$$ of $$G$$, of a group $$\mathcal{G}_v$$.
We write $$\mathcal{G}$$ for the graph of groups.
Associated to $$\mathcal{G}$$ we can form a *graph of spaces* $$X_{\mathcal{G}}$$ à la Scott and Wall.
For each vertex $$v$$ of $$G$$, take a CW complex $$X_v$$ with one vertex $$\star_v$$
that is a $$K(\mathcal{G}_v,1)$$.
The space $$X_{\mathcal{G}}$$ is formed from the disjoint union of these CW complexes
by adding, for each edge $$e$$ of $$G$$ with initial vertex $$v$$ and terminal vertex $$w$$,
an edge connecting $$\star_v$$ to $$\star_w$$.
There is a natural "retraction" $$r\colon X_{\mathcal{G}} \to G$$ 
that collapses each $$K(\mathcal{G}_v,1)$$
to the vertex $$\star_v$$.

The *fundamental group of the graph of groups $$\mathcal{G}$$*
is the fundamental group of the graph of spaces $$X_{\mathcal{G}}$$.
If we choose a basepoint $$p \in X_{\mathcal{G}}$$ in the image of the retraction,
we may homotope each element of $$\pi_1(X_{\mathcal{G}},p)$$ into the $$1$$-skeleton,
and further to an *edge path in $$\mathcal{G}$$* of the form

$$\gamma = e'_1g_1e_2g_2\ldots e_kg_ke'_{k+1},$$ 

where $$e'_1$$ and $$e'_{k+1}$$ are terminal and initial segments 
of oriented edges $$e_1$$ and $$e_{k+1}$$ of $$G$$,
respectively, where $$e_2,\ldots,e_k$$ are oriented edges of $$G$$,
where $$g_i$$ for $$1 \le i \le k$$ is an element of $$\mathcal{G}_{v_i} = \pi_1(X_{v_i},\star_{v_i})$$,
and where $$v_i$$ is the terminal vertex of the edge $$e_i$$ 
and the initial vertex of the edge $$e_{i+1}$$.
Notice that this notion makes sense without reference to $$X_{\mathcal{G}}$$.
Homotopy rel endpoints for edge paths in $$\mathcal{G}$$ has a combinatorial flavor
that makes no reference to $$X_{\mathcal{G}}$$:
it is generated by performing multiplication or factoring in vertex groups
and adding or removing subpaths of the form $$e \bar e$$, where $$\bar e$$ is the edge 
$$e$$ in its opposite orientation.
An edge path is *tight* if the number of edges in the path cannot be decreased by a homotopy.
Every edge path is homotopic to a unique tight path (which may contain no edges).

Bass–Serre theory asserts that $$F = \pi_1(\mathcal{G},p) = \pi_1(X_{\mathcal{G}},p)$$
is a free product of the form

$$F = A_1 * \cdots * A_n * F_k,$$

Where the $$A_i$$ are the nontrivial vertex groups of $$\mathcal{G}$$
and $$F_k$$, a free group of rank $$k$$,
is the ordinary fundamental group of $$G$$.

## The Bass–Serre tree

Given a graph of groups with trivial edge groups $$\mathcal{G}$$
and a point $$p \in G$$,
we wish to define a free splitting $$\Gamma$$ of $$F$$ equipped with a basepoint $$\tilde p$$
called the *Bass–Serre tree* of $$\mathcal{G}$$.
Given a vertex $$v$$ of $$G$$, write $$[p,v]$$ for the set of homotopy classes
of edge paths in $$\mathcal{G}$$ beginning at $$p$$ and ending at $$v$$.
There is a natural right action of $$\mathcal{G}_v$$ on $$[p,v]$$
defined by $$\gamma.g = \gamma g$$.
Let $$V$$ be the set of vertices of $$G$$.
The vertex set of $$\Gamma$$ 
is the set

$$\coprod_{v \in V}[p,v]/\mathcal{G}_v.$$

Two vertices $$[\gamma] \mathcal{G}_v$$ and $$[\gamma']\mathcal{G}_w$$
are adjacent in $$\Gamma$$ if and only if the path
$$\bar\gamma\gamma'$$ is homotopic to a path of the form $$g e g'$$,
i.e. a path of length one.
One can check that this is well-defined independent of the choice of representatives
$$\gamma$$ and $$\gamma'$$.
There is a natural action of $$F = \pi_1(\mathcal{G},p)$$ on $$\Gamma$$
defined as $$[\gamma].[\sigma]\mathcal{G}_v = [\gamma\sigma]\mathcal{G}_v$$.
The fundamental theorem of Bass–Serre theory
asserts that $$\Gamma$$ is a tree, that the $$F$$-action has trivial edge stabilizers,
and that the "quotient graph of groups" $$F\backslash\backslash\Gamma$$,
which I won't describe here,
is naturally identified with $$\mathcal{G}$$.
Let $$\pi\colon \Gamma \to G$$ be the natural projection.

Suppose $$\gamma$$ is a tight path in $$\mathcal{G}$$ beginning at a vertex $$v$$
and ending at a vertex $$w$$.
A lift $$\tilde v$$ of $$v$$ to $$\Gamma$$ is determined by a tight path $$\sigma$$ from $$p$$ to $$v$$.
The path $$\gamma$$ lifts uniquely to a tight path $$\tilde\gamma$$ in $$\Gamma$$ 
beginning at $$\tilde v$$:
it is the unique tight path connecting the vertex $$[\sigma]\mathcal{G}_v$$ to the vertex
$$[\sigma\gamma]\mathcal{G}_w$$.
More generally it is possible to lift edge paths that are not tight
or do not begin and end at vertices.
In particular lifting the trivial path at $$p$$ defines a basepoint $$\tilde p$$ in $$\Gamma$$.

## Maps of graphs of groups with trivial edge groups

Let $$\mathcal{G}$$ be a graph of groups with trivial edge groups
and $$X_{\mathcal{G}}$$ an associated graph of spaces.
A *map of graphs of groups with trivial edge groups*
$$f\colon \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{G}$$
is a pair of maps $$f_X\colon X_{\mathcal{G}} \to X_{\mathcal{G}}$$
and $$f\colon G \to G$$ such that the following diagram commutes

$$\require{AMScd}\begin{CD}
X_{\mathcal{G}} @>f_X>> X_{\mathcal{G}} \\
@VrVV @VVrV \\
G @>f>> G.
\end{CD}$$

A *homotopy* of maps of graphs of groups with trivial edge groups
is a pair of homotopies such that the relevant diagram commutes.
A map $$f\colon \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{G}$$ is a *homotopy equivalence*
if, as usual, there is a map $$g\colon \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{G}$$
such that $$gf$$ and $$fg$$ are each homotopic to the identity map.

It is not too hard to see that each map $$f\colon \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{G}$$
is homotopic to one that sends the vertices $$\star_v$$ of $$X_{\mathcal{G}}$$
to vertices of $$X_{\mathcal{G}}$$
and further sends edges of $$G \subset X_{\mathcal{G}}$$
to (possibly trivial) edge paths in $$\mathcal{G}$$.

Like edge paths, a map of graphs of groups with trivial edge groups
that is a homotopy equivalence has a combinatorial shadow in $$\mathcal{G}$$
that does not depend on $$X_{\mathcal{G}}$$:
the data of $$f$$ is a continuous map $$f\colon G \to G$$
taking vertices to vertices and edges to edge paths,
along with for each edge $$e$$ of $$G$$,
an edge path $$f(e)$$ in $$\mathcal{G}$$,
and for each vertex $$v$$ of $$G$$ with nontrivial vertex group,
an isomorphism $$f_v\colon \mathcal{G}_v \to \mathcal{G}_{f(v)}$$.
Homotopy for maps of graphs of groups has a combinatorial shadow in $$\mathcal{G}$$ as well;
I won't describe it.

Suppose $$f\colon \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{G}$$ is a homotopy equivalence
of the form above.
Given a basepoint $$p \in G$$ and a path $$\sigma$$ from $$p$$ to $$f(p)$$,
the homotopy equivalence $$f$$ induces an automorphism
$$\Phi \colon \pi_1(\mathcal{G},p) \to \pi_1(\mathcal{G},p)$$ by the rule

$$\Phi([\gamma]) = [\sigma f(\gamma) \bar\sigma].$$

If $$\Gamma$$ is the Bass–Serre tree of $$\mathcal{G}$$ with basepoint $$\tilde p$$ lifting $$p$$,
the choice of path $$\sigma$$ also defines a lift
$$\tilde f\colon \Gamma \to \Gamma$$ defined as follows:
A point $$\tilde x$$ of $$\Gamma$$ is determined by an edge path $$\gamma$$ in $$\mathcal{G}$$
beginning at $$p$$:
if $$\tilde x$$ is a vertex, the path $$\gamma$$ is any path in the $$\mathcal{G}_x$$-orbit
$$[\gamma]\mathcal{G}_x$$ determining $$\tilde x$$.
In this case, the point $$\tilde f(\tilde x)$$ is $$[\sigma f(\gamma)]\mathcal{G}_{f(x)}$$.
One checks that this is independent of the choice of $$\gamma$$.
This can be extended to define $$\tilde f$$ for points that are not vertices.
The map $$\tilde f$$ is $$\Phi$$-*twisted equivariant* in the sense that

$$ \tilde f(g.\tilde x) = \Phi(g).\tilde f(\tilde x)$$

for each point $$\tilde x \in \Gamma$$ and element $$g$$ of $$\pi_1(\mathcal{G},p)$$.
We say that $$\tilde f$$ *corresponds to $$\Phi$$.*

## A little about the map $$D\tilde f$$

Continuing notation from the previous paragraph,
let $$\tilde v$$ be the vertex $$[\gamma]\mathcal{G}_v$$ of $$\Gamma$$.
Suppose the final vertex group element of $$\gamma$$ is trivial.
A lift $$\tilde f\colon \Gamma \to \Gamma$$ of $$f$$
determined by the choice of path $$\sigma$$ from $$p$$ to $$f(p)$$
satisfies $$\tilde f(\tilde v) = \tilde v$$ if and only if
$$f$$ fixes $$v$$ and
$$\sigma$$ is homotopic to a path of the form $$\gamma h f(\bar\gamma)$$ for $$h \in \mathcal{G}_v$$.
A *direction at $$\tilde v$$* is an edge $$\tilde e$$ with initial vertex $$\tilde v$$.
The map $$g \mapsto [\gamma g\bar\gamma]$$ determines an isomorphism from $$\mathcal{G}_v$$
to the stabilizer of $$\tilde v$$ in $$\pi_1(\mathcal{G},p)$$.
Under this isomorphism there is a (left) action of $$\mathcal{G}_v$$ 
on the set of directions based at $$\tilde v$$.
Let $$\operatorname{st}(v)$$ be the set of edges of $$G$$ with initial vertex $$v$$.
There is a $$\mathcal{G}_v$$-equivariant bijection from the set of directions based at $$\tilde v$$
with the set

$$\coprod_{e \in \operatorname{st}(v)} \mathcal{G}_v\times \{e\}$$

defined as follows.
Let $$\tilde w$$ be the terminal vertex of the edge $$\tilde e$$.
The map sends $$\tilde e$$ to the pair $$(g,e)$$
if we have $$\tilde w = [\gamma ge]\mathcal{G}_w$$.
The map $$\tilde f\colon \Gamma \to \Gamma$$
induces a map $$D\tilde f$$ of the set of directions at $$\tilde v$$
as follows: $$D\tilde f(\tilde e)$$ is the first edge on the edge path $$\tilde f(\tilde e)$$.
We have 

$$\tilde f(\tilde w) = [\sigma f(\gamma ge)]\mathcal{G}_{f(w)} 
= [\gamma h f(\bar\gamma)f(\gamma)f_v(g)f(e)]\mathcal{G}_{f(w)}
= [\gamma h f_v(g) f(e)]\mathcal{G}{f(w)}.$$

If the edge path $$f(e)$$ begins $$g_0 e_1$$,
we see that $$D\tilde f(g,e) = (hf_v(g)g_0,e_1)$$.

## My latest point of confusion

Suppose $$\tilde v$$ has infinite valence,
or equivalently that the group $$\mathcal{G}_v$$ is infinite.
Let's assume $$\mathcal{G}_v$$ is countable.
To get the result that I want, I'm happy to restrict further,
and I'm particularly interested in the case where $$\mathcal{G}_v$$ is virtually finite-rank free.

Suppose $$\tilde f$$ is a lift of $$f\colon \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{G}$$ that fixes $$\tilde v$$.
We say that $$\tilde f$$ is *principal* if $$\operatorname{Fix}(\tilde f)$$ contains at least two points
or if $$D\tilde f$$ fixes a direction based at $$\tilde v$$.
Two lifts $$\tilde f$$ and $$\tilde f'$$ fixing $$\tilde v$$ 
corresponding to elements $$h$$ and $$h'$$ in $$\mathcal{G}_v$$
are *isogredient*
if there exists $$c \in \mathcal{G}_v$$ such that
the maps $$D\tilde f$$ and $$D\tilde f'$$ satisfy $$D\tilde f' = c D\tilde f c^{-1}$$:
that is,
for a direction $$(x,e)$$,
we have $$(h' f_v(x) g_0,e_1) = (ch f_v(c^{-1}) f_v(x) g_0,e_1)$$,
which holds if and only if $$ h' = ch f_v(c^{-1})$$.
It's not too hard to see that if $$(x,e)$$ is a fixed direction for $$D \tilde f$$,
then $$cx$$ is a fixed direction for $$D\tilde f'$$,
or more generally if $$(x,e)$$ is a periodic direction for $$D\tilde f$$,
then $$cx$$ is a periodic direction for $$D\tilde f'$$.
We are interested in principal lifts up to isogredience,
so we may simplify things by noting that up to isogredience, if there is a fixed point,
we may assume that it is of the form $$(1,e)$$.
In this case, we have

$$D\tilde f(1,e) = (hg_0,e),$$

so we conclude that $$h = g_0^{-1}$$.
Therefore up to isogredience, fixed directions are pretty simple.
Periodic directions are a little more complicated: 
assuming that $$e_1 = e$$,
the condition that $$(1,e)$$ is mapped to itself by $$D\tilde f^k$$
is that 

$$h f_v(h)f_v^2(h)\ldots f_v^{k-1}(h)f_v^{k-1}(g_0)f_v^{k-2}(g_0) \ldots f_v(g_0)g_0 = 1.$$

What I want is sufficient conditions on $$\mathcal{G}_v$$
to guarantee the existence of $$k > 0$$ independent of the choice of lift $$\tilde f$$
such that if $$D\tilde f^k$$ has a periodic direction,
then that direction is fixed.
As already noted, we may simplify up to isogredience by assuming that the identity is periodic.
