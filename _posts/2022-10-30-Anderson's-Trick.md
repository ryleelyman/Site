This week I had the pleasure of attending a seminar talk
[Nick Vlamis](https://math.nickvlamis.com) gave at CUNY,
where he taught us a very pretty trick due to [Anderson](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2372842)
which one can use, as Anderson did,
to prove that the groups of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms 
of the $$2$$- and $$3$$-spheres are simple.
The purpose of this post is to reproduce Nick's exposition of the trick.

Suppose $$g$$ is a homeomorphism of a surface $$S$$
(for me a surface is a Hausdorff and second countable $$2$$-manifold)
whose *support*

$$\operatorname{Supp}(g) = \overline{\{x \in S : g(x) \ne x\}}$$

is contained in the interior of some closed disk $$D$$ in $$S$$.
Since $$\operatorname{Supp}(g)$$ is closed,
there is in fact some closed disk $$\Delta$$ properly contained in $$D$$ 
and containing $$\operatorname{Supp}(g)$$.
In fact, we can find a countable sequence of disjoint disks
$$\{\Delta_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}$$ with $$\Delta = \Delta_0$$, 
each contained in the interior of $$D$$.
Since a sequence of points, one from each disk must have a limit point in $$D$$,
why don't we arrange the $$\Delta_n$$ to *Hausdorff converge*
to a point $$x_{+\infty}$$ as $$n \to +\infty$$
and a point $$x_{-\infty}$$ as $$n \to -\infty$$.
Here's the picture.

![The countable disjoint union of disks and their two limit points](/assets/img/anderson.jpeg)

Here's how we'll use these disks.
There is a homeomorphism $$\varphi\colon D \to D$$ which shifts each $$\Delta_n$$ to $$\Delta_{n+1}$$
and holds $$x_{\pm\infty}$$ fixed.
Since the $$\Delta_{n}$$ are pairwise disjoint,
if we choose distinct $$n$$ and $$m$$,
the homeomorphisms $$\varphi^n g \varphi^{-n}$$ and $$\varphi^m g \varphi^{-m}$$
have disjoint support and thus commute.
Thus the infinite product
$$\sigma = \prod_{n = 0}^\infty \varphi^n g\varphi^{-n}$$ makes sense 
as a homeomorphism whose support is contained in $$D$$.

> **Proposition.**
> 1. $$[\sigma,\varphi] = \sigma\varphi\sigma^{-1}\varphi^{-1} = g$$.

*Proof.*
From the definition of $$\sigma$$ we have $$\varphi\sigma^{-1}\varphi^{-1} 
= \prod_{n=1}^\infty \varphi^n g^{-1} \varphi^{-n}$$
from which it follows that $$\sigma(\varphi\sigma^{-1}\varphi^{-1}) = g$$.
We claim that $$g = [\sigma,f]\psi [\sigma,f]\psi^{-1}.$$
Expanding, we see that this is a product of conjugates of $$f$$ and $$f^{-1}$$ 
and is thus contained in any normal subgroup containing $$f.$$

To see that this product is really $$g$$,
observe that since $$\sigma$$ is supported on $$D$$,
for $$x \in D$$, we have $$\sigma f \sigma^{-1}f^{-1}(x) = \sigma(x)$$.
On the other hand, for $$x \in f(D)$$, we have $$\sigma f \sigma^{-1}f^{-1}(x) = \sigma^{-1}(x)$$.
Thus if $$x \in D$$, 

$$\psi\sigma f \sigma^{-1}f^{-1}\psi^{-1}(x) = \psi\sigma f \sigma^{-1} f^{-1} f\varphi^{-1}(x) 
= \psi f \sigma^{-1} \varphi^{-1}(x) = \varphi \sigma^{-1} \varphi^{-1}(x)$$

which is in $$D$$, so further applying $$\sigma f\sigma^{-1} f^{-1}$$ we obtain
$$\sigma \varphi \sigma^{-1} \varphi^{-1}(x) = g(x)$$.

Next, if $$x \in f(D)$$, we have $$\psi^{-1}(x) = f^{-1}(x) \in D$$,
applying $$\psi [\sigma,f]$$ yields $$f \sigma f^{-1}(x),$$
and further applying $$\sigma f \sigma^{-1} f^{-1}$$ yields $$\sigma(x) = x$$, since $$x \notin D$$.

Finally, if $$x \notin D \cup f(D)$$,
note that $$f^{-1}\psi^{-1}(x)$$ is not in $$D$$,
so we have $$\psi[\sigma, f]\psi^{-1}(x) = x$$ and in fact the whole product fixes $$x$$.
Thus we have shown that $$g = [\sigma, f]\psi[\sigma,f]\psi^{-1}$$. $$\blacksquare$$

### Simplicity of $$\operatorname{Homeo}_+(S^2)$$.

Now, all of $$\operatorname{Homeo}(S^2)$$ cannot be simple,
since it has an action on the $$2$$-element set of orientations of $$S_2$$.
On the other hand, let's show that $$\operatorname{Homeo}_+(S^2)$$ is simple.
To do so, we want to apply the proposition,
for which we need to express any given orientation-preserving homeomorphism $$h\colon S^2 \to S^2$$
as being built out of homeomorphisms supported on disks.

Suppose at first that $$h$$ fixes some (topological) circle on $$S^2$$.
Then $$h$$ is the product of $$h^+$$ and $$h^-$$, 
which are supported in the two hemispheres (thanks Schoenflies!) determined by the circle.
If $$h$$ does not fix a given circle $$C$$,
say one disjoint from some fixed point $$p$$ of $$h$$,
there is again a homeomorphism $$h'$$ of $$S^2$$
fixing $$p$$ taking $$h(C)$$ back to $$C$$ 
(thanks [Schoenflies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schoenflies_problem)!)
so that the composition $$h'h$$ fixes $$C$$,
and we can use the argument from above.
It looks like this expresses $$h$$ as the product of three homeomorphisms supported in disks,
but Nick observed that we can actually combine $$h'$$ with one of $$h^+$$ or $$h^-$$,
so only two are needed.

Anyway, now we have $$h = h^+h^-$$ where each of $$h^+$$ and $$h^-$$ 
are supported in disks $$D^+$$ and $$D^-$$.
If $$f$$ displaces $$D^+$$ (i.e. $$f(D^+) \cap D^+ = \varnothing$$)
and $$\iota_+^-$$ is an orientation-preserving homeomorphism of $$S^2$$ taking $$D^+$$ to $$D^-$$,
(one exists! I think this is still thanks Schoenflies!)
we have that $$\iota_+^- f (\iota_+^-)^{-1} (D^-) \cap D^- = \varnothing$$.
Indeed, if our original $$f$$ had a $$\psi$$,
then our new $$\iota_+^- f (\iota_+^-)^{-1}$$ has one.

It follows from the proposition, assuming we can construct $$\psi$$,
that $$h^+$$ and $$h^-$$ are both products of conjugates of $$f$$, so so is $$h$$.
But now $$f$$ itself can be arbitrary so long as it's nontrivial,
for if $$f(x) \ne x$$, we can find an open neighborhood small enough that it is moved entirely off itself,
and this open neighborhood contains some disk that $$f$$ therefore displaces.
Therefore the smallest normal subgroup of $$\operatorname{Homeo}_+(S^2)$$ containing a nontrivial element
is the whole groupâ€”we've shown it is simple.

### Other results

From here it's actually not too hard to show that $$\operatorname{Homeo}_+(S^2)$$ is coarsely bounded.
Originally I was going to give some argument here,
but I have to turn in an application tomorrow, so I'll sign off and work on that instead.
