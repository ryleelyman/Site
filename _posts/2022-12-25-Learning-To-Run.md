Happy holidays!
One of my goals for this past year was to record and release
an album of music,
totalling at least thirty minutes
and ten tracks.
I accomplished that goal!
You can listen to and buy the album [on Bandcamp](https://alanza.bandcamp.com/album/learning-to-run)
and it is also available on most streaming platforms as well.

I wrote about the album [on Lines](https://llllllll.co/t/alanza-learning-to-run),
a forum centered around music, computers and synthesis that I am a moderator of.
Briefly, though, I wanted to collect some thoughts about it here as well.
I set myself a constraint for the album:
I wanted to use only the [Max4Live devices](https://github.com/ryleelyman/bitters-max) that I created
that serve as polysynth, monosynth and drum synth.
When I sat down to finish the third track,
I discovered that it wanted vocals,
and was surprised to discover that I didn't hate the sound of my own voice
quite as much;
as a result there are vocals on seven of the ten tracks.

One of the gratifying parts of creating things like the synthesizer plugins
is learning and being surprised by them.
I was very pleased to discover the range that these plugins have.

Partway through the year, Lines users @sixolet and @nonverbalpoetry
released [sacred cyborg harmony](https://llllllll.co/t/sacred-cyborg-harmony),
a script for the monome [norns](https://monome.org/norns)
that allows you to harmonize vocals Ã  la Imogen Heap's [Hide and Seek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYIAfiVGluk).
I was super inspired by this script; it appears on three of the tracks,
and I bought a mic stand in order to better use it.

The album was mixed and mastered by my friend [StephTheGirl](https://stephthegirl.bandcamp.com),
who did a truly incredible job
making my demos sparkle and shine.
