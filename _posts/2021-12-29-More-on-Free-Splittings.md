Let $$F$$ be a group.
A *free splitting* of $$F$$ is a simplicial tree $$T$$
equipped with an $$F$$-action
such that edge stabilizers are trivial.
I've been thinking a lot about free splittings;
here are some of my musings.
There isn't really a punch line here,
but since it was clarifying to write this, I may as well post it.

We are interested in free splittings where there are finitely many orbits of edges
and some vertex has infinite stabilizer.
In this case, Bassâ€“Serre theory shows that $$F$$
is a free product of the form

$$F = A_1*\cdots*A_n*F_k$$

where the $$A_i$$ are countable groups
(at least one of which is infinite)
and $$F_k$$ is a free group of finite rank $$k$$.

## The Gromov boundary of $$T$$

Fix a basepoint $$p \in T$$.
A *geodesic ray* in $$T$$ based at $$p$$
is a proper embedding $$\xi\colon [0,\infty) \to T$$
such that $$\xi(0) = p$$.
We are really interested in the image of $$\xi$$ more than the map.
Similarly we have *geodesics;* embeddings $$[0,1] \to T$$.
Every path in $$T$$ is homotopic rel endpoints to a unique geodesic or to a constant map.
Let $$\partial_\infty T$$ denote the set of geodesic rays in $$T$$ based at $$p$$.
This is the *Gromov boundary* of $$T$$.
We may topologize $$T \cup \partial_\infty T$$ by giving $$T$$ the usual topology
and defining basic open neighborhoods of boundary points in the following way.
Given a boundary point $$\xi$$, the basic open neighborhood is determined by a finite subpath
$$\gamma$$ of the ray $$\xi$$;
the basic open set $$N(\gamma)$$ consists of those points $$x \in T \cup \partial_\infty T$$
such that the geodesic from $$p$$ to $$x$$ contains $$\gamma$$.
In [July][Boundaries1], we showed that in our situation,
if all the groups $$A_i$$ are countable and one is countably infinite,
then the Gromov boundary of $$T$$ is homeomorphic (in the subspace topology) to the Baire space.

## The observer's topology

We may give $$T \cup \partial_\infty T$$ a different topology
that makes it into a compact space:
this is the *observer's topology,* coined by [Coulbois, Hilion and Lustig][CHL].
Let $$x \in T$$ be a point.
A *half-tree* based at $$x$$ is a component of $$T \setminus \{x\}$$.
A subbasis for the observer's topology on $$T \cup \partial_\infty T$$ 
is given by the set of half-trees;
where we say a boundary point $$\xi \in \partial_\infty T$$ belongs to a half-tree
if the corresponding geodesic ray has infinite intersection with the half-tree.
In our situation, where the groups $$A_i$$ are countable,
the tree $$T$$ has countably many edges, so has a countable dense subset.
Since every point supports at most countably many half-trees,
it follows that the observer's topology on $$T \cup \partial_\infty T$$ is second countable.
Thus it makes sense to talk about the topology in terms of convergent sequences:
a sequence $$\{x_n\} \in T \cup \partial_\infty T$$ converges to a point $$x$$
if for every point $$y \ne x$$,
the points $$x_n$$ belong to the same half-tree at $$y$$ as $$x$$ for $$n$$ sufficiently large.

Coulbois, Hilion and Lustig show that $$T \cup \partial_\infty T$$ is compact in the observer's topology.
Here is their argument:
suppose $$\{x_n\}$$ is a sequence,
and let $$\{U_i\}$$ be a countable set of half-trees 
generating the topology on $$T \cup \partial_\infty T$$
For each $$U_i$$, we may, after passing to a subsequence,
assume that $$x_n$$ either belongs to $$U_i$$ or not for $$n$$ large.
Now note that the intersection of (the images of) two (distinct)
geodesics or geodesic rays based at $$p$$
is either a point or a geodesic.
Let $$\gamma_n$$ denote the geodesic or geodesic ray from $$p$$ to $$x_n$$,
and consider the geodesic

$$I_k = \bigcap_{m \ge k} \gamma_m.$$

Observe that $$I_k \subset I_{k+1}$$, so

$$\overline{\bigcup_k I_k}$$

is a geodesic or geodesic ray; let its endpoint be $$x$$.
We will show that our subsequence $$\{x_n\}$$ converges to $$x$$.
Suppose for $$n \ge N$$ we have that $$x_n \notin U_i$$.
Then for any finite collection of such $$x_n$$,
the subtree spanned by the collection is entirely outside $$U_i$$,
since the (closed) complement of a half-tree is convex.
The nearest point to $$p$$ belongs to this spanning subtree,
so inductively this shows that the endpoint of $$I_k$$ is outside $$U_i$$ for large $$k$$.
It follows that $$x \notin U_i$$. 
Therefore if $$x \in U_i$$, then infinitely many,
and thus all but finitely many of the $$x_n$$ belong to $$U_i$$,
showing that the sequence $$\{x_n\}$$ converges to $$x$$.

Next we would like to show that the topology induced on $$\partial_\infty T$$
agrees with the one above.
Suppose $$\{x_n\}$$ converges to $$\xi \in \partial_\infty T$$ in the observer's topology,
so for any point $$y \in T$$,
the points $$x_n$$ belong to the same half-tree at $$y$$ as $$\xi$$ for $$n$$ large.
Taking the points $$y$$ to be on the geodesic ray $$\xi$$
shows that the geodesic or geodesic ray from $$p$$ to $$x_n$$
must contain any finite subpath of $$\xi$$ for $$n$$ large.
If conversely the geodesic or geodesic ray from $$p$$ to $$x_n$$
contains any finite subpath of $$\xi$$ for $$n$$ sufficiently large,
then if the intersection of the ray $$\xi$$ with a given half-tree is infinite,
we may take a finite subpath $$\gamma$$ so large that it ends inside the half-tree.
If the geodesic or geodesic ray from $$p$$ to $$x_n$$ contains $$\gamma$$,
then since $$T$$ is a tree, we conclude that $$x_n$$ belongs to the half-tree.

## The Bowditch Boundary of $$T$$

It's not hard to see that if $$x \in T$$ is a point of finite valence,
(i.e. either a vertex of finite valence or a point in the interior of an edge)
then there is a basic open set containing $$x$$ that contains only points of finite valence.
If we write $$V_\infty(T)$$ for the set of vertices of infinite valence,
this argument shows that $$\partial T = \partial_\infty T \cup V_\infty(T)$$
is closed in the observer's topology,
hence it is compact.
This is the *Bowditch boundary* of $$T$$.
In fact, we showed in [July][Boundaries1] that $$\partial T$$ is a Cantor set;
one might think of the points $$V_\infty(T)$$ as being akin to the rational points
of the standard middle-thirds Cantor set.

## Laminations

Consider the space

$$\tilde{\mathcal{B}}(T) = ((\partial T \times \partial T)\setminus \Delta )/ \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$$

where $$\Delta$$ is the diagonal and $$\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$$ acts by interchanging the coordinates.
Thus $$\tilde{\mathcal{B}}(T)$$ is the space of unordered pairs of points
in the Bowditch boundary of $$T$$.
The diagonal action of $$F$$ on $$\partial T$$ extends to an action on $$\tilde{\mathcal{B}}(T)$$.
A *lamination* is an $$F$$-invariant closed subset of $$\tilde{\mathcal{B}}(T)$$.

Given a point $$\xi \in \partial_\infty T$$, there is a lamination $$\Lambda(\xi)$$
called the *limit set* of $$\xi$$ defined as follows.
A point $$(\alpha,\omega) \in \tilde{\mathcal{B}}(T)$$ belongs to $$\Lambda(\xi)$$
if (possibly after swapping $$\alpha$$ and $$\omega$$),
there is a sequence $$\{g_n\}$$ of elements of $$F$$
such that the sequence $$\{g_n.p\}$$ converges to $$\alpha$$
and the sequence $$\{g_n.\xi\}$$ converges to $$\omega$$.
