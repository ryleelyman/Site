This is the sixth post in a series on Katie Mann and Kasra Rafi's paper
[Large-scale geometry of big mapping class groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10914).
The purpose of this post is to discuss when a Polish group is generated by a coarsely bounded set,
and give examples of mapping class groups which are locally coarsely bounded but fail this criterion.

## The general case

We have the following theorem of Rosendal.

> **Theorem 1.2** ([Rosendal](http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~rosendal/PapersWebsite/Coarse-Geometry-Book17.pdf)).
Let $$G$$ be a Polish group.
Then $$G$$ is generated by a coarsely bounded set if and only if
$$G$$ is locally coarsely bounded and not the countably infinite union of a chain of proper, open subgroups.

Let's make sense of this.
Note that countable, discrete groups are Polish.
Being generated by a coarsely bounded set is the analogue of finite generation for discrete groups,
so we should expect that for a countable discrete group 
(which is automatically locally coarsely bounded, having finite discrete neighborhoods of the identity)
being finitely generated is equivalent to not being the countably infinite union of a chain of proper subgroups,
which are automatically open.

Indeed, suppose $$G$$ is finitely generated by a set $$S$$,
and that $$G_1 < G_2 < G_3 < \cdots$$ is a strictly increasing chain of proper subgroups.
Since the union of the $$G_i$$ is $$G$$,
each $$s \in S$$ belongs to some $$G_i$$,
but then at some finite stage $$G_n$$, we have each $$s \in S$$ contained in $$G_n$$,
so actually $$G_n = G$$.

Conversely, supposing every strictly increasing chain of proper subgroups terminates,
we show that $$G$$ is finitely generated.
Indeed, we can take a sequence of finitely generated subgroups!
Begin with $$G_1 = \langle s_1 \rangle$$ for some $$s_1 \in G$$.
At each stage, add $$s_{n+1} \notin G_n$$ and take $$G_{n+1} = \langle s_1,\ldots,s_{n+1}\rangle$$.
Since this sequence terminates,
we've proven that $$G$$ is finitely generated.
(This proof contains the useful fact
that every generating set for a finitely generated group
contains a \emph{finite} generating set.)

## A non-example: limit type

Remember the "Great Wave off Kanagawa" surface from [the previous post]?
It had genus zero and end space homeomorphic to $$\omega^\omega + 1$$ in the order topology.
Take the connect sum of two copies of that surface;
so the genus-zero surface with end space homeomorphic to $$\omega^\omega \cdot 2 + 1$$.
It looks a little like this:

![The connect sum of two copies of the "Great Wave off Kanagawa" surface](/assets/img/doublewave.jpeg)

The original "Great Wave" surface has self-similar end space and genus zero,
so has coarsely bounded mapping class group.
This surface $$\Sigma$$ has locally coarsely bounded mapping class group,
but we will show that $$\operatorname{Map}(\Sigma)$$ is not generated by a coarsely bounded set.
Consider the index-two subgroup $$G$$ of $$\operatorname{Map}(\Sigma)$$
comprising those mapping classes that fix pointwise the two maximal ends.
We'll show that $$G$$ is a countable union of proper open subgroups $$G_0 < G_1 < \cdots$$.
Since $$G$$ has index two in $$\operatorname{Map}(\Sigma)$$,
this will show that $$\operatorname{Map}(\Sigma)$$ is also a countable union of proper open subgroups
$$G'_0 < G'_1 < \cdots$$,
where each $$G'_i$$ is obtained from $$G_i$$
by adding a fixed mapping class $$\phi$$ that swaps the two maximal ends of $$\Sigma$$.
(Recall that a subgroup is open if and only if it contains an open neighborhood of the identity,
so the $$G'_i$$ are open since $$G$$ is open in $$\operatorname{Map}(\Sigma)$$ and the $$G'_i$$ are open in $$G$$.)

To start, consider a simple closed curve $$\alpha$$ separating $$\Sigma$$ into two pieces,
each containing exactly one maximal end.
The identity neighborhood we consider is $$U_A$$, where $$A$$ is an annular subsurface
with core curve $$\alpha$$.
Since $$U_A$$ is a subgroup of $$G$$, we'll let $$G_0 = U_A$$.
Since $$\operatorname{Map}(\Sigma)$$ and hence $$G$$ is Polish,
there is a countable dense subset $$\{\phi_i : i \in \mathbb{N}\}$$ of $$G$$.
Any open subgroup containing the $$\phi_i$$ is in fact all of $$G$$,
so consider the sequence of open subgroups $$G_1 \le G_2 \le \cdots$$,
where

$$G_i = \langle G_0, \phi_1,\ldots, \phi_i \rangle.$$

If we can show that each $$G_i$$ is a proper subgroup of $$G$$, we will be done,
even though *a priori* this chain may not be strictly increasing.
Consider a maximal end $$\xi$$ and a neighborhood basis of $$\xi$$
comprising nested clopen neighborhoods $$U_j$$ with $$U_{j+1} \subset U_j$$,
beginning with $$U_0$$ being the end set of the component of $$\Sigma - A$$ containing $$\xi$$.
In the figure we can think of the clopen neighborhoods as coming from the "fluting" process
described in [the previous post].
Thus, $$U_0 - U_j$$ contains points homeomorphic to $$\omega^{j-1} + 1$$
but not points homeomorphic to $$\omega^j + 1$$.
In plainer words, $$U_0 - U_1$$ contains isolated planar ends,
$$U_0 - U_2$$ contains ends accumulated by isolated planar ends,
$$U_0 - U_3$$ contains ends accumulated by ends accumulated by isolated planar ends,
so on and so forth.

![The neighborhood basis of a maximal end](/assets/img/neighborhoodbasis.jpeg)

Anyway, consider $$\phi_1,\ldots,\phi_n$$.
Since each $$\phi_i$$ leaves $$\xi$$ invariant,
we claim that there exists $$M$$ large such that for all $$m \ge M$$,
ends homeomorphic to $$\omega^m + 1$$ contained in $$U_m$$ actually remain inside $$U_m$$
under each $$\phi_i$$.
To see this, note that if there was a sequence of ends $$\{\xi_m\}$$
with each $$\xi_m$$ homeomorphic to $$\omega^m + 1$$
such that each $$\xi_m$$ was moved outside of $$U_m$$ by some $$\phi_i$$,
then since the sequence $$\{\xi_m\}$$ necessarily converges to $$\xi$$,
by the pigeonhole principle some $$\phi_i$$ would have to move $$\xi$$.
This already shows us that $$G_i$$ is a proper subgroup of $$G$$,
since by the classification of surfaces
we can move some $$\xi_m$$ with $$m > M$$ outside of $$U_m$$ 
(and into a neighborhood of the other maximal end).

This surface $$\Sigma$$ is an example of the general phenomenon
Mann–Rafi term having end space of "limit type".
The argument we just gave generalizes
to show that if $$\Sigma$$ has limit type 
(see Definition 6.2 of their paper for a precise definition)
then $$\operatorname{Map}(\Sigma)$$ cannot be generated by a coarsely bounded set.

## A non-example: infinite rank

If $$G$$ is a finitely generated group,
notice that all (*a fortiori* continuous) quotients of $$G$$ are finitely generated,
and that conversely if $$G$$ has a quotient that is not finitely generated,
then $$G$$ cannot be finitely generated.
The same is true of Polish groups and coarsely bounded generation:
if $$G$$ is a Polish group that has a continuous quotient
which is not coarsely boundedly generated, then $$G$$ is not either.
A prime example of such a group as a quotient 
is the countably infinite group $$\bigoplus_{n = 1}^\infty \mathbb{Z}$$.

It is possible to build continuous maps to $$\bigoplus_{n=1}^\infty \mathbb{Z}$$
by using the topology of the end space.
Here is one example.
Consider the ends $$\xi_n$$ constructed in [the previous post]
which are pairwise noncomparable.
The $$\xi_n$$ are maximal ends of self-similar surfaces,
so have stable neighborhoods.
We form a surface by "fluting" together the union of countably infinitely many copies of each $$\xi_n$$.
Necessarily each collection of ends locally homeomorphic to $$\xi_n$$ converges to the maximal end of the flute.
Now, this surface is self-similar, with genus zero or infinity, hence has coarsely bounded mapping class group.
So take the connect sum of two copies of this surface, and call the connect sum $$\Sigma$$.

As before, take a simple closed curve $$\alpha$$ that separates $$\Sigma$$ into two pieces,
each one containing a single one of the two maximal ends.
Pick one of the maximal ends, call it $$\xi$$,
and let $$U$$ be the neighborhood of $$\xi$$ determined by $$\alpha$$.
We claim that for each end $$\xi_n$$ and any mapping class $$\phi$$ 
belonging to the index-two subgroup of $$\operatorname{Map}(\Sigma)$$ fixing $$\xi$$,
the number of ends locally homeomorphic to $$\xi_n$$ 
mapped into and out of $$U$$ is finite.
Indeed, were either quantity infinite, the same argument as in the previous example
shows that $$\phi$$ would have to move $$\xi$$.

Anyway, count up the number of ends of type $$\xi_n$$ moved into $$U$$ by $$\phi$$
and subtract the number of ends of type $$\xi_n$$ moved out of $$U$$ by $$\phi$$.
This defines a homomorphism $$\ell_n \colon G \to \mathbb{Z}$$.
By "shifting a strip of ends locally homeomorphic to $$\xi_n$$",
we can show that $$\bigoplus_{n=1}^\infty \ell_n\colon G \to \bigoplus_{n=1}^\infty \mathbb{Z}$$ is surjective,
and continuous, since if $$A$$ is an annular subsurface with core curve $$\alpha$$,
the open set $$U_A$$ is contained in the kernel of $$\bigoplus_{n=1}^\infty \ell_n$$.

This surface $$\Sigma$$ is an example of the general phenomenon
Mann–Rafi term having end space of "infinite rank".
The argument we just gave generalizes
to show that if $$\Sigma$$ has infinite rank
(see Definition 6.5 for a precise definition)
then $$\operatorname{Map}(\Sigma)$$ cannot be generated by a coarsely bounded set.
