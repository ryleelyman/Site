Along with [Macarena Arenas][Macarena], [Sami Douba] and [Abdul Zalloum],
I am organizing a virtual "summer school" that began today and will run until July 2.
More info is available on the [summer school website](https://sites.google.com/view/ggtwbii/).
This is the second iteration of the summer school!
I spoke in the first iteration; the purpose of this post is to house links to the notes,
recordings and exercises for the mini-course I gave.

I gave three lectures in this summer school on Bass and Serre's theory
of graphs of groups and groups acting on trees.

Here are notes (with the annotations I added live)
for the lectures, as well as links to recordings of the lectures.
 - Lecture 1 [PDF][Lecture1PDF], [Notability][Lecture1Note], [YouTube][Youtube1]
 - Lecture 2 [PDF][Lecture2PDF], [Notability][Lecture2Note], [YouTube][YouTube2]
 - Lecture 3 [PDF][Lecture3PDF], [Notability][Lecture3Note], [YouTube][YouTube3].
[Here][exercises] are some suggested exercises.
