<p>
This is a post about a triangulation algorithm
to support the creation and rendering of arbitrary 2D meshes
in Zig and Metal.
Triangulation is a pretty neat piece of math!
</p>

<p>
But first, why?
Off and on I’ve been working on <a href="https://github.com/rainbow-apps/prism">prism</a>,
a Zig library that aims to support creation of native apps.
At the moment it only does something interesting on macOS,
since that’s the operating system I’m usually running,
but eventually I’d like to include various configurations
of macOS, Linux and Windows,
along with Metal, OpenGL, Vulkan and D3D12 as graphics backends.
The idea is that by breaking out this work as a library,
I can reap the benefits in <a href="https://github.com/ryleelyman/seamstress">seamstress</a>
as well as any later projects I might dream up.

Do you ever forget that a thing can happen?
Like, imagine a quadrilateral,
a shape with four edges.
I bet the shape you imagined had the property of being <i>convex,</i>
i.e. if you drew the two diagonals of the quadrilateral,
those diagonals would actually be on the <i>inside</i> of the shape.
Certainly this is true of my imagined quadrilateral.
In fact, it takes me a minute to remember that I can imagine
a shape that isn’t a rectangle or a parallelogram!
</p>

<p>
But there are quadrilaterals that are not convex;
a “dart” shape might be a good example.
Or like, take your favorite triangle,
pick a side and imagine “pushing it in” a little to form two new sides.
That’s a perfectly good quadrilateral that won’t be convex.
</p>

<p>
Now imagine you’re a computer trying to draw that quadrilateral all filled in.
It’s funny how things that can go wrong in math
often already go wrong very quickly.
Like, there’s no bad way for a computer to draw a triangle,
but shapes with four sides?
Many ways to screw up.
</p>

<p>
As I said, it’s pretty easy for computers to draw filled-in triangles,
and any quadrilateral can be cut—using its diagonals—into two triangles
in two ways.
But! for a non-convex quadrilateral,
there’s a <i>visually incorrect</i> way of doing the cutting!
In fact, there’s another way to screw up entirely!
</p>

{{< figure src="/img/badquads.jpeg" >}}

<p>
In the figure above, I’ve illustrated two ways things could go wrong.
In the first one, the true “dart” shape is not drawn by the computer
because we’ve chosen the wrong diagonal
to cut the quadrilateral into triangles—the correct choice
would be the diagonal which <i>is</i> contained inside the dart shape.
</p>

<p>
But in the second one, the computer chooses entirely the wrong triangles!
Even though this quadrilateral <i>is</i> convex,
we’ve managed to draw a kind of folded shape instead,
because the computer doesn’t know that the repeated edge
has to be a diagonal of the shape and not one of the edges.
</p>

<p>
For shapes that have more vertices,
there are even more ways things can go wrong!
Delaunay triangulation attempts to fix them.

Suppose we have a 2-dimensional shape with \(n\) points;
Let’s clarify what we want:
mathematically, the shape is a polygon of some sort—let’s
assume at first that we don’t allow the construction of any holes.
Then the shape, topologically, is just a disc, a filled-in circle.
Of course, <i>geometrically</i> that’s very much not true,
it’s got sides with straight edges and everything,
but this is still a useful observation;
here’s why:
consider your favorite polygon.
It’s got \(n\) vertices (three, say, for a triangle),
\(n\) edges (right? if we order the vertices around the shape,
there’s an edge from each vertex to the next one,
which gives us \(n - 1\) of the edges,
and then there’s one final edge from the last vertex back to the first one),
and \(1\) face.
There’s a cool topological property of two-dimensional shapes
called the <i>Euler characteristic,</i>
which we can compute by adding the vertices and faces
and subtracting the edges:
sometimes this is abbreviated symbolically as
\(\chi = V - E + F\).
Anyway, doing this for a polygon gives us \(n - n + 1 = 1\).
The really neat thing here
is that <i>the Euler characteristic is a topological property;</i>
so anything that is <i>topologically</i> a disc
will have \(V - E + F = 1\).
So like, if you took a quadrilateral
and <i>subdivided</i> it by drawing in the diagonal contained inside of it,
now we have \(V = 4\), but \(E = 5\) and \(F = 2\),
because we added one new edge and the one previous face now is two faces,
and we see that \(V - E + F = 4 - 5 + 2 = 1\) is still true.
</p>

<p>
So. If we have \(n\) points which we are declaring to be vertices
in our shape,
we might hope to be able to <i>compute</i> the number of triangles
our eventual triangulation will have.
For quadrilaterals this is true:
there will always be two triangles.
But imagine adding a new vertex.
If the new vertex is sort of “off to one side”,
it makes sense to triangulate the resulting pentagonal shape
with only three triangles—imagine
triangulating a regular pentagon by drawing two “chords”
from one vertex to the non-adjacent vertices.
</p>

<p>
But there’s another situation:
if one of the vertices is “inside” the other four,
then we need <i>four</i> triangles:
like, imagine starting with a square
and then declaring the point where the two diagonals cross to be a vertex.
</p>

<p>
So again, convexity is a core issue here.
There are kind of two approaches to solving this.
For a general mishmash of vertices,
i.e. if we <i>don’t</i> assume that our vertices are sorted in some way,
the choice to be non-convex seems pretty arbitrary.
So in this case, let’s assume that the user wants
the resulting shape to be convex.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
In the case of convexity, there is a neat triangulation
called the <i>Delaunay</i> triangulation which we will produce.
For a quadrilateral, the Delaunay triangulation could have
as many as <i>three</i> triangles:
what’s at issue here is the <i>convex hull</i> of the vertices,
that is, the smallest convex shape that contains all of them.
This shape could be a triangle (like it is for the dart)
or a quadrilateral.
We already know that we can triangulate a quadrilateral with two triangles,
but if we put a vertex in the interior of a triangle,
we have to split that triangle into <i>three</i> to produce a triangulation
with four vertices.
</p>

<p>
The Euler characteristic is actually pretty useful here:
Every <i>edge</i> of the triangulation that is an edge of the convex hull
belongs to <i>one</i> triangle,
while other edges belong to <i>two.</i>
Therefore if the convex hull of \(n\) points has \(m \le n\) vertices,
there are \(m\) edges that belong to exactly one triangle,
and the <i>actual</i> triangulation we will produce
can be obtained from the convex polygon by dividing faces.

<h3 id="org4e5eb92"><span class="section-number-3">3.1.</span> Circumcircles</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
Here a useful tool we will need in order to determine how many triangles
to add is the <i>Delaunay</i> condition:
given the three vertices of a triangle
(a genuine triangle, not the vertices of a line),
there is always a circle which meets those three points.
This is the <i>circumcircle</i> of the triangle.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, a triangulation satisfies the <i>Delaunay condition</i>
if no vertex of the triangulation lies <i>inside</i>
the circumcircle determined by any other three points of the triangulation.
</p>

<p>
While for points in <i>general position,</i>
that is, no three of them lie on a line,
Delaunay triangulations turn out to <i>exist,</i>
they are sometimes not unique:
this happens when four or more of the points lie on the same circle.
</p>

<p>
Let’s try and see why this is the right condition
by looking above: in the first of our “bad” cases,
the larger triangle (mixed shading)
actually contains the fourth vertex,
so it’s certainly true that the <i>circumcircle</i>
associated to this triangle would contain the other vertex.
</p>

<p>
The second bad case is similar: it’s kind of hard to see
with the way I’ve drawn it, but if you imagine keeping the folded shape
but wiggling the “ears” of the fold,
you can see that the circumcircles fail the Delaunay condition.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
So, given a set of \(n\) vertices,
how do we find a Delaunay triangulation for them?
We’ll describe an algorithm due independently to Bowyer and Watson
(the Wikipedia article notes that each of Bowyer and Watson
devised the algorithm at basically the same time;
they <i>both</i> published their papers in the same 1981 issue of the same journal,
which is a cute fact.)
</p>

<p>
Start like this:
given three vertices (in general position),
the <i>only</i> triangle that contains them
is certainly Delaunay.
Next we’ll attempt to add a vertex.
Now, normally there would be two cases,
according to whether the new vertex
is inside or outside of the original triangle’s circumcircle.
What’s more, if we were in the circumcircle
but not in the interior of the triangle,
we might have to find out which of the triangles
we’d like to add should actually be added.
</p>

<p>
So let’s cheat:
<i>start with a triangle so big</i> that every time we add a new vertex,
it’s actually <i>inside that triangle.</i>
At the end we can <i>throw those vertices away</i>
and we’ll have a perfectly good triangulation of the stuff inside.
</p>

<p>
Turns out to be not so bad to find such a big triangle:
it’s easy to find a rectangle that contains all the points
(just find the maximum and minimum \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates),
then give yourself a little more wiggle room if you’d like,
and realize that you can compute the side lengths of an
isosceles right triangle containing the square
with the larger of the two side lengths of the rectangle…
by using the Pythagorean theorem and a little geometry.
</p>

<p>
<i>Anyway,</i> we also need to know when a triangle
contains a vertex in its circumcircle.
Many ways to do that;
one is using determinants.
Fortunately I believe I’ve actually already written code to compute those
using row reduction
(as part of Advent of Code).
</p>

<p>
That done, we proceed as follows:
when adding a new vertex,
we check the triangles in our previous triangulation
to see which ones contain the new vertex in their circumcircle.
These triangles will form some sort of polygon,
which we retriangulate by adding the triangles
formed by taking the newly added vertex and connecting it
to each exterior edge of the polygon.
Finally, when we’re done, we just throw away
any triangle which contains a vertex from our original huge triangle.
