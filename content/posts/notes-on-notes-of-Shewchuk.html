<p>
After my last post, I tried and failed to implement
the Bowyer–Watson algorithm. A picture of that failure is below—turns
out plotting semi-random triangular meshes with random colors?
Very pretty.
Anyway, I was talking about my struggles with the algorithm on a Discord
and <a href="http://dewb.org">Michael Dewberry</a> kindly directed me to
<a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/meshpapers/delnotes.pdf">some notes by Jonathan Richard Shewchuk</a>.
They’re <i>fantastic,</i> and the purpose of this post,
besides providing a place for me to put the link in case I lose it,
is to do a little riffing.

<p>
I wanted to say something to the effect that the Euler characteristic—number
of vertices minus number of edges plus number of faces (e.g. triangles)
actually provides a <i>bound</i> on the number of triangles in a triangulation
of \(n\) points, but I backed off from stating that last time.
Shewchuk offhandedly provides the bound, so let’s derive it.
</p>

<p>
First of all, we argued in the last post that for a triangulation of a disc,
we have \(\chi = V - E + F = 1\).
We know \(V = n\) and would like to know how big \(E\) and \(F\) can be.
So let’s get to it. In a triangulation,
each face is a triangle, naturally,
and each triangle has three vertices and three edges,
so naively we can say that \(E \le 3F\).
This is not an equality typically
(unless \(V = 3\), in which case we have exactly one triangle
with three edges, right?)
because triangles can and must <i>share edges.</i>
But think about it: can an edge be contained in more than two triangles?
Well no: if it were, one of the triangles wouldn’t be able to “lie flat”;
we would be triangulating something other than a topological disc.
In fact, we can say something stronger:
if we have \(m\) <i>exterior</i> vertices—i.e. vertices that are extremities
of our topological disc,
then we also have \(m\) exterior <i>edges</i> which are each contained in exactly
<i>one</i> triangle, and every <i>other</i> edge is contained in exactly two triangles.
Thus we can count \(m + 2(E - m)\) triangles.
Actually this is a huge <i>overcount</i> because
each triangle has three edges.
So in fact we have \(3F = m + 2(E - m)\).
</p>

<p>
Let’s sum up.
If we have \(k\) interior vertices,
We know that \(V = m + k = n\),
that \(V - E + F = 1\)
and that \(3F = m + 2(E - m)\).
Substituting \(E = V + F - 1\),
we have that
\(3F = m + 2(V + F - 1 - m) = m + 2k + 2F - 2\),
so we conclude that \(F = m + 2k - 2\).
Notice that we <i>have</i> to have at least \(3\) exterior vertices
(assuming that we’re not looking at a vertex or a line),
in which case \(k = n - 3\),
so we <i>always</i> have \(F \le 3 + 2(n - 3) - 2 = 2n - 5\),
and therefore \(E \le 3n - 6\).
In fact, we have equality whenever the <i>convex hull</i> of the \(n\)
vertices is a single triangle with the rest of the vertices in the interior.
So for example if \(n = 3\), we have \(2n - 5 = 6 - 5 = 1\) and
\(3n - 6 = 9 - 6 = 3\).

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Do you remember parabolas from school?
The function \(y = x^2\)?
If you turn it upside down you get “gravity’s rainbow”
(that is, the ideal trajectory of an object launched into the air
and acted upon by gravity)
as Thomas Pynchon put it.
Parabolas are “convex” or “concave up” functions,
in the sense that if you plot a parabola (that opens upward)
and draw the straight line between any two points on the parabola,
the graph of the function lies below that line.
</p>

<p>
This observation is actually fantastically useful for us!
Remember from the last post that for a vertex set,
to produce the Delaunay triangulation,
we would like for each triangle in the triangulation
to have the property that <i>no</i> other vertex
lies within the circumcircle of that triangle.
</p>

<p>
But how do we show that that’s the case?
Let’s go <i>down</i> a dimension
(a surprisingly useful mathematical strategy!)
and see what happens.
So instead of triangles,
let’s care about line segments.
A “$1$-dimensional” triangulation,
then, is just a way of connecting points on a line
by segments so that the segments do not overlap.
In other words,
we would like that for each segment \(\overline{AB}\) in our “triangulation”
and any other point \(C\),
it is not the case that \(C\) is in the "circumcircle"
determined by \(\overline{AB}\).
Here a circumcircle is just the segment \(\overline{AB}\) itself,
and we're asking that \(C\) is not between \(A\) and \(B\) on the line.
</p>

<p>
That's easy enough to do that the parabola picture seems a little silly,
but it <i>does</i> work:
if we apply the function \(y = x^2\) to our points,
we have that \(C\) is between \(A\) and \(B\)
if and only if it lies <i>below</i> the line
determined by the points \((A, A^2)\) and \((B, B^2)\).
</p>

<p>
The neat thing is that is true even when we go up a dimension!
Here the function is \(z = x^2 + y^2\),
but the observation still holds:
in two dimensions, a point \(D\) is within the circumcircle
of the triangle \(\triangle ABC\)
if and only if it is <i>below</i> the 2-dimensional plane
determined by the image of the three points under the function
\(z = x^2 + y^2\)!

So given three points of the form \((x, y, x^2 + y^2)\),
we're looking to find an equation for the plane containing them,
or even better, a function
which will tell us (based on the sign of its output)
whether a fourth point is above or below the plane they determine.
</p>

<p>
A little linear algebra is useful here:
in three dimensions,
a plane is determined by any of its <i>normal vectors,</i>
which point perpendicularly away from it:
like, think of the plane as determined by the \(x\) and \(y\) axes;
the \(z\) axis would determine a normal vector.
<i>Perpendicular</i> here means this:
if \(\vec n\) is the normal vector
and \(\vec p\) is another point,
that point will lie on the plane through the origin determined by \(\vec n\)
if and only if the <i>dot product</i> \(\vec n \cdot \vec p\) is zero.
</p>

<p>
If we write things out in coordinates,
with \(\vec n = (n_1, n_2, n_3)\) and \(p = (p_1, p_2, p_3)\),
then we're asking that \(n_1 p_1 + n_2 p_2 + n_3 p_3 = 0\).
</p>

<p>
But! our plane is probably not through the origin.
Put another way, it's an <i>affine</i> plane, rather than a linear one.
But there's a fun trick we can play:
move into a <i>fourth dimension.</i>
I'm sure I'll have much more to say about this trick another time,
but here's a fun way to think of things.
</p>

<p>
Again, before we think about four dimensions, let's go down to, like, one.
</p>

<p>
A $1$-dimensional vector space is just the real line.
An <i>affine</i> $0$-dimensional subspace is a point on that line.
Every (nonempty) vector space has a unique $0$-dimensional <i>linear</i> subspace:
the origin.
In other words, if we require things to contain the origin,
the zero,
we actually aren't able to reason about <i>other points,</i>
even though they're manifestly very useful.
But there's a fix:
put that line into a 2-dimensional vector space (a plane).
For concreteness, let's do this
so that it's the horizontal line \(y = 1\).
Now for every <i>point</i> \(p\) on that line,
there's a unique <i>line</i> in the plane
that hits that point \(p\) and also the origin.
Explicitly, we've thought about \(p\) as the point \((p,1)\)
and the line is the origin plus all those points \((x,y)\)
such that \(x / y = p\).
</p>

<p>
This is the basis of <i>projective</i> geometry
and there are so many fun things to say.
Maybe I'll just confine myself to saying that
all the <i>affine</i> subspaces of a vector space \(V\),
say \(\mathbb{R}^n\),
are <i>linear</i> subspaces of \(V \oplus \mathbb{R}\),
so \(\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\),
<i>plus</i> an extra subspace "at infinity".
So for our example of points on the line,
we get an extra "point at infinity",
which corresponds to the linear subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^2\)
spanned by \((1, 0)\).
This line is <i>parallel</i> to the line \(y = 1\),
so only "meets" it "at infinity".
Projective geometry is really so fun, but maybe I'll stop there with it.
</p>

<h3 id="org646f448"><span class="section-number-3">3.1.</span> Projective planes in \(\mathbb{R}^4\)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
So, where were we?
Oh right, finding an equation for an affine plane in \(\mathbb{R}^3\).
Well, an affine plane
is a <i>linear</i> $3$-dimensional subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^4\).
If we started with three points in \(\mathbb{R}^2\)
with coordinates \(x\) and \(y\),
we get a $3$-dimensional subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^4\)
spanned by vectors of the form \((x, y, x^2 + y^2, 1)\).
</p>

<p>
A fourth point will lie <i>on</i> the circle determined by the first three
if and only if the set of four resulting vectors in \(\mathbb{R}^4\)
is linearly dependent.
What's more, we can extract more information:
let's go down a dimension or two.
Think about a pair of linearly independent vectors in \(\mathbb{R}^2\).
We can form the \(2\times 2\) <i>matrix</i>
with those vectors as columns.
Like, for example \(\vec x = (1,0)\) and \(\vec y = (0,1)\).
Notice that the square determined by these vectors has area
equal to the (absolute value of the) <i>determinant</i> of the matrix
\(\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}\),
which is \(1 * 1 - 0 * 0 = 1\).
In general, the area of the parallelogram
spanned by two vectors \((a,b)\) and \((c,d)\)
is \(|ad - bc|\).
By <i>convention</i> we say that these vectors are <i>positively oriented</i>
if the determinant \(ad - bc\) is positive.
Thus we should list \(\vec x\) before \(\vec y\).
</p>

<p>
Now suppose the plane spanned by our vectors is a
linear subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^3\).
There is still a notion of determinant
for \(3\times 3\) (and in general \(n\times n\)) matrices,
and we can notice that if our plane is the $xy$-plane in \(\mathbb{R}^3\)
and our third vector is \(\vec z = (0,0,z)\),
the <i>determinant</i> (which is more complicated to write out)
of the \(3\times 3\) matrix will be positive
if and only if two things happen:
one, the vectors spanning the plane are positively oriented,
and two, \(z > 0\).
</p>

<p>
Zooming all the way back out,
this tells us that the <i>sign</i> of a \(4\times 4\) determinant
can tell us whether a fourth point is inside or outside of a circumcircle.
</p>

<p>
Explicitly, the matrix in question is
</p>

<p>
\(\begin{pmatrix}
a_x & b_x & c_x & d_x \\
a_y & b_y & c_y & d_y \\
a_x^2 + a_y^2 & b_x^2 + b_y^2 & c_x^2 + c_y^2 & d_x^2 + d_y^2 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}\)
</p>

<p>
But! There's a catch:
we need to know that the points \(A\), \(B\) and \(C\)
are in some sense positively oriented.
What's that about, and can we detect that mathematically?
Let's go down a dimension:
pretend that \(A\) is the origin.
We said that the (positive) $x$-axis should come <i>before</i>
the positive $y$-axis,
because the determinant of \(\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}\)
is positive, while the determinant of
\(\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\ 1 & 0\end{pmatrix}\)
is negative.
In fact, if we keep \(A\) where it is at the origin,
we see that this means walking around the triangle \(\triangle ABC\)
from \(A\) to \(B\) to \(C\)
is <i>counterclockwise</i>
(assuming as usual that positive \(x\) is to the right
and positive \(y\) is up.)
</p>

<p>
In other words, this will be the case just when the determinant
of the \(2\times 2\) matrix
\(\begin{pmatrix}
b_x - a_x & c_x - a_x \\
b_y - a_y & c_y - a_y
\end{pmatrix}\) is positive.
But let's get a little galaxy-brained for a second:
what if we don't like the subtraction there?
Our affine triangle
is a cross-section of a <i>linear</i> parallelepiped
(like a parallelogram but three-dimensional)
spanned by the vectors \((a_x, a_y, 1)\) in \(\mathbb{R}^3\).
The vertices of this triangle
are in counterclockwise order
if and only if the determinant of the corresponding \(3\times 3\)
matrix is positive!
(Right? If the triangle was the points \((0,0)\), \((1,0)\) and \((0,1)\),
then the parallelepiped goes from \((0,0,1)\) to \((1,0,1)\) to \((0,1,1)\),
and an easy “expansion by minors” argument
shows that the determinant of
\(\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}\)
is positive.)
</p>

<p>
In other words,
we may as well evaluate the \(3\times 3\) determinant
\(\begin{pmatrix}
a_x & b_x & c_x \\
a_y & b_y & c_y \\
1 & 1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}\)
instead!
</p>

<p>
I think this stuff is just so neat.
