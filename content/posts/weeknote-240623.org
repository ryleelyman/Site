A “weeknote”, I am told, is best written on a Friday,
and yet here I am putting this second one up on Sunday night.
I am sovereign of my domain name, I shall do as I see fit.

- Like 15 people came out to my show last Saturday expressly to see me perform?
- I'm thoroughly touched. I haven't had that many people show up for me since college.
- I'm writing / performing music for a play that will be put on in November
  that my friend Raymond wrote and is producing / directing.
- The name of the play is “The Play About The Blowjob”, and our first rehearsal was this afternoon.
- It was so fun! I read for one of the characters that doesn’t at the moment have an actor
  and had a blast.
- My cat Nastya is so loved. She might not be around for much longer.
- I worked and reworked at the way TUI interaction feels all this week.
- Realized that rather than “entities”, what I wanted was “events”,
  which can be both posted and handler registered for.
- So put together a “pub-sub” model inspired by =mediator_lua=.
- This system is really great, especially that it’s accessible from basically anywhere.
