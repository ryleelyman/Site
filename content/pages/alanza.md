## Music
I record music as Alanza.
Last year I released my first album, *Learning to Run*,
which you can buy on [Bandcamp](https://alanza.bandcamp.com/album/learning-to-run)
or listen to on streaming ([Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/alanza/1660654188),
or [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/4d5GbrGiYBGdZKHUXpa6AD?si=pjxBQ2LlQziFII6HCjoDAg)
for instance).

I appeared on [Dan Derks's](https://dndrks.com) lovely [Sound and Process](https://soundcloud.com/sound-and-process/episode-24) podcast
to talk about many things including the process of making the album.

## Lines
I'm a moderator of the forum [Lines](https://llllllll.co),
a forum about art, music, technology, etc.
It would be great to have you join the conversation.

## Seamstress
Recently I've been working on [seamstress](https://github.com/ryleelyman/seamstress)
(lines thread [here](https://llllllll.co/t/seamstress-v0-5-0-midi/62356?u=alanza)),
a Lua scripting environment for macOS (and eventually Linux)
for working with [monome](https://monome.org) devices, MIDI, OSC, etc.
The Lua API is documented [here][API].

Seamstress is inspired by matron, a component of monome's [norns](https://monome.org/norns),
which was written by [Ezra Buchla](https://github.com/catfact).

## Norns Scripts
I've written a couple scripts for the norns as well.
You can find them and perhaps too many other things on my [GitHub](https://github.com/ryleelyman).
