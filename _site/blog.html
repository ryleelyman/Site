    <h2><a href="/2022/03/27/Ideal-edges.html">Ideal Edges</a></h2>
	  March 27, 2022<br />
      <p><p>Let’s once again fix a group \(G\) that acts cocompactly on a tree \(T\).
In the <a href="/2022/03/26/Shelters-in-graphs-of-groups.html">previous post</a> we defined what it meant for an edge of \(T\) 
to be <em>surviving</em> or <em>collapsible.</em>
Collapsing orbits of collapsible edges in \(T\) yields
a new tree \(T'\) which we say is obtained from \(T\) by forest collapse.
Two trees \(T\) and \(T'\) are in the same <em>deformation space</em>
if there are \(G\)-equivariant maps \(T \to T'\) and \(T' \to T\).
The set of \(G\)-equivariant homeomorphism classes of trees in the same deformation space as \(T\)
all of whose edges are surviving
is partially ordered under the operation of forest collapse,
and this partial order contains minimal elements, which are <em>reduced</em> trees.
To study this poset, or its geometric realization \(L_T(G)\),
it would be convenient to understand all trees collapsing onto a given reduced tree.
This is captured in the idea of an <em>ideal edge,</em>
which I’d like to describe in this post.
The idea of an ideal edge goes back to Culler and Vogtmann’s
<a href="https://marc-culler.info/static/home/papers/OuterSpace.pdf">original paper</a> on Outer Space;
the treatment here is adapted from a paper of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226534036_Equivariant_outer_space_and_automorphisms_of_free-by-finite_groups/link/5762c70508aee61395bef5dc/download">Krstić and Vogtmann</a>.</p>

	  March 26, 2022<br />
      <p><p>Let’s fix a group \(G\) that acts cocompactly on a tree \(T\).
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0107008">Forester</a> introduced the notion of a <em>deformation</em> of the tree \(T\)
and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0605545">Guirardel and Levitt</a> studied the <em>deformation space</em>
\(\mathscr{D}\) consisting of trees obtainable from \(T\) by a finite sequence of deformations.
Usually we assume \(G\) to be finitely generated,
but it’s not clear to me how often this assumption is necessary.
Maybe that’ll be a topic for another blog post.
In this post I want to discuss the notion of a <em>shelter,</em>
which Guirardel and Levitt (and also <a href="https://mattclay.hosted.uark.edu/Papers/def.pdf">Clay</a>) 
use to construct a deformation retraction of \(\mathscr{D}\) (or its simplicial spine)
onto a smaller, often finite-dimensional, space.</p>

	  January 6, 2022<br />
      <p><p>In the previous post, we defined <em>free splittings</em> for a group \(F\).
The quotient of a free splitting \(T\) of \(F\) by the action of \(F\)
is a <em>graph of groups with trivial edge groups.</em>
The purpose of this post is to introduce <em>maps</em> of graphs of groups with trivial edge groups
and explore lifting maps of the quotient graph of groups to twisted equivariant maps 
of the tree \(T\).</p>

      <p><p>Let \(F\) be a group.
A <em>free splitting</em> of \(F\) is a simplicial tree \(T\)
equipped with an \(F\)-action
such that edge stabilizers are trivial.
I’ve been thinking a lot about free splittings;
here are some of my musings.
There isn’t really a punch line here,
but since it was clarifying to write this, I may as well post it.</p>

      <p><p>As a mathematician,
I collaborate with other mathematicians on papers.
I’ve used Overleaf, emailing the paper back and forth,
and taking turns in Dropbox as my mode of collaboration.
I <em>haven’t</em> collaborated using Git, but I sure would like to.
The purpose of this post is for mathematicians
like for example my younger self,
who are familiar with the command line
and curious about Git as a tool,
and for whatever reason don’t have the patience for something like “Git for Poets.”
I explain Git just enough to get you started on a simple project,
and hopefully enough so that you can start
Googling things you’re unfamiliar with.
I’m not an expert, and I expect my inexpertise to show.</p>

	  July 25, 2021<br />
      <p><p>The other day on Twitter I asked whether it might be the case that a non-proper
hyperbolic metric space might still have locally compact Gromov boundary.
I was particularly interested in the case of a simplicial tree
equipped with the path metric where each edge has length \(1\)
with some vertices of infinite valence.
The answer in this case is <em>no.</em>
Instead, the boundary of such a tree is homeomorphic to the <em>Baire space</em> \(\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}\).
In this post I’ll talk through why this is the case.
There is also a notion of a <em>Bowditch boundary</em> for a tree with vertices of infinite valence.
I’d like to show that the Bowditch boundary of such a tree is a Cantor set.</p>

	  July 19, 2021<br />
      <p><p>The other day I “proved” the Farrell–Jones conjecture for a family of groups.
The word “proved” is in quotes because actually there was nothing to prove,
I just happened to be primed to notice that all the conditions were already there.
The purpose of this post is to tell you the story of how this came to be
and give the sketch of the proof that requires zero input from me.</p>

	  July 1, 2021<br />
      <p><p>Gromov’s original definition of Gromov hyperbolicity makes sense for arbitrary metric spaces.
However, it is only a quasi-isometry invariant for geodesic metric spaces.
I learned this from a
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0723086905000113?via%3Dihub">paper of Väisälä</a>.
The purpose of this post is to understand the counterexample he gives.
I also define Gromov hyperbolicity and quasi-isometry in this post,
which might make it useful for future reference.
The reader already familiar with Gromov hyperbolicity and quasi-isometries
might wish to skip ahead to the heading below.</p>

	  June 27, 2021<br />
      <p><p>The Farey graph, or Farey diagram,
is an object that appears in many guises throughout math.
For me, it appears several times as a complex related to
the outer automorphism group of a free group of rank two,
but it has connections to things like continued fractions as well.
The purpose of this post is introduce the Farey graph
and prove a couple of basic properties of it.</p>

with a free action on a <em>real tree</em> is a free product of free abelian and surface groups.
The purpose of this blog post is to introduce real trees and illustrate this theorem by constructing

      <p><p>Train track maps, which also come in “relative” and other flavors,
are particularly nice homotopy equivalences of graphs
used as tools to reason about outer automorphisms of free groups.
I wrote a paper extending train track maps (as well as relative train track maps and “CTs”)
to graphs of groups (with trivial edge groups for CTs).
In this post I want to talk a little about how to think about train track maps
and (“tame” in some sense) homotopy equivalences of graphs of groups more generally.
At the end of the post I talk through using the train track algorithm
to compute an example coming from a pseudo-Anosov 5-braid.</p>

      <p><p>This is a post about one of those things that is really a case of category theory

      <p><p>Given a topological space \(X\) and a continuous map \(\pi\colon X \to Y\),
there is an adjunction between the categories of sheaves on \(X\) and sheaves on \(Y\).
The adjunction is somewhat mysterious to me as I begin to write this,

	  July 10, 2020<br />
      <p><p>There is a “sheaf-theoretic” definition of something like a <em>cotangent space at a point</em>
for a locally-ringed space.
In the case of the sheaf of differentiable functions on a smooth manifold,
the two definitions—sheaf-theoretic and the usual one in differential geometry—agree.
What’s more, modulo the appropriate background technology in both subjects,
the proof is beautiful and simple—I feel like shouting it from the rooftops
at the moment, so this blog post will try and give a little exposition.
I’ll try to move briskly without assuming total familiarity with either side of things.</p>
