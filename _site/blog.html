    <h2><a href="/2019/09/06/Choo-Choo.html">Choo Choo</a></h2>
      <p><p>Today I posted my first paper, 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03097">Train Tracks, Orbigraphs and CAT(0) Free-by-cyclic Groups</a>
to the ArXiv! In it I give an extension to automorphisms of free products
of the algorithmic construction of relative train track maps for outer automorphisms
of free groups. I use it to prove that mapping tori of polynomially-growing automorphisms
of certain kinds are CAT(0) groups. I want to talk about the main ideas in the proof.
I haven’t addressed the question of “why” study these groups in this post, but
I will another time.</p>

      <p><p>In a poor attempt to remain interesting to the non-mathematically inclined
reader, maybe it would be good to begin with a few words about the landscape.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2019/06/29/The-Category-of-Graphs.html">The Category Of Graphs</a></h2>
      <p><p>You know the sensation where a familiar word becomes suddenly
completely <em>strange</em> for no apparent reason? Like suddenly the scales
fall away from your eyes and you see how utterly weird it is that a
concept has a particular name? I’ve been having that feeling with the
word <em>graph</em> as I use it in math.</p>

Marc Weidenbaum of <a href="https://disquiet.com">disquiet.com</a> wrote a <a href="https://disquiet.com/2019/06/16/word-blog-20th-anniversary-1999/">paean
to the blog</a> that I found really inspiring. “Self-publishing,”
he writes, “is the heart of the healthy internet.”</p>
