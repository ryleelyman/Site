However, it is only a quasi-isometry invariant for geodesic metric spaces.
I learned this from a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0723086905000113?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;paper of Väisälä&lt;/a&gt;.
The purpose of this post is to understand the counterexample he gives.
I also define Gromov hyperbolicity and quasi-isometry in this post,
which might make it useful for future reference.
The reader already familiar with Gromov hyperbolicity and quasi-isometries
might wish to skip ahead to the heading below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let \((X,d)\) be a metric space.
We say that \(X\) is a &lt;em&gt;length space&lt;/em&gt; if the distance between any two points \(x\) and \(y\) in \(X\)
is equal to the infimum of the length of a path joining them.
A &lt;em&gt;geodesic&lt;/em&gt; in \(X\) is a path \(\gamma\colon [a,b] \to X\) from a closed interval \([a,b] \subset \mathbb{R}\)
such that \(d(\gamma(s),\gamma(t)) = |s-t|\) for all \(s\) and \(t\) in the interval \([a,b]\).
We say that \(X\) is a &lt;em&gt;geodesic&lt;/em&gt; metric space if any two points can be joined by a geodesic.
Geodesic metric spaces are length spaces but not necessarily conversely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gromov’s original definition of hyperbolicity of \(X\) is the following.
Given points \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\) in \(X\), define the &lt;em&gt;Gromov product&lt;/em&gt;
of \(x\) and \(y\) with respect to \(z\) to be the quantity&lt;/p&gt;

\[(x,y)_z = \frac{1}{2}\left(d(x,z) + d(y,z) - d(x,y)\right).\]

&lt;p&gt;Then we say that \(X\) is &lt;em&gt;\(\delta\)-hyperbolic&lt;/em&gt; if there exists some \(\delta \ge 0\)
with the property that for any four points \(x\), \(y\), \(z\) and \(w\) in \(X\),
we have&lt;/p&gt;

\[(x,z)_w \ge \min\{(x,y)_w,(y,z)_w\} - \delta.\]

&lt;p&gt;Let’s try and make sense of this.
The intuition for the Gromov product is the following.
A &lt;em&gt;tripod&lt;/em&gt; is a metric tree with four vertices, three of which are leaves and one of which has valence three.
Given any triple of points \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\) in a metric space,
you should convince yourself that we can always construct a tripod
with leaves \(\hat x\), \(\hat y\) and \(\hat z\) such that we have&lt;/p&gt;

\[d(x,y) = d(\hat x,\hat y),\quad d(x,z) = d(\hat x,\hat z),\quad\text{and}\quad d(y,z) = d(\hat y,\hat z).\]

&lt;p&gt;In this situation, the Gromov product \((x,y)_z\)
is equal to the distance from \(\hat z\) to the center vertex of the tripod.
To make sense of the hyperbolicity condition,
let’s continue to think about trees,
only in this case assume that \(X\) itself is a metric tree.
Then in this case it’s not too hard to argue that the hyperbolicity condition holds with \(\delta = 0\);
a picture illustrating the general case is below.
Thus one way to think of \(\delta\)-hyperbolicity is to think that from the point of view of any point \(w \in X\),
triangles in \(X\) look like triangles in trees, up to an error of \(\delta\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/GromovProduct.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Trees are $$0$$-hyperbolic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If \(X\) is a geodesic metric space, there are other conditions equivalent to this one
that are more directly about the geometry of, e.g. triangles in \(X\).
I’ve been collecting as many of these conditions as the community will give me
in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://mathoverflow.net/q/396359/135175&quot;&gt;MathOverflow post&lt;/a&gt;.
Eventually I expect to make a blog post or several about the various definitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given metric spaces \((X,d_X)\) and \((Y,d_Y)\) and constants \(K \ge 1\) and \(C \ge 0\),
a &lt;em&gt;\((K,C)\)-quasi-isometric embedding&lt;/em&gt; is a function \(f\colon X \to Y\)
(it need not be continuous)
such that for all points \(x\) and \(y\) in \(X\), the following inequality holds&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac 1Kd_X(x,y) - C \le d_Y(f(x),f(y)) \le Kd_X(x,y) + C.\]

&lt;p&gt;So we see that \(f\) is allowed to distort distances by a bounded multiplicative and additive amount.
A &lt;em&gt;\((K,C)\)-quasi-isometry&lt;/em&gt; is a \((K,C)\)-quasi-isometric embedding with the additional property that
for every point \(y \in Y\) there is a point \(x \in X\) such that \(d_Y(y,f(x)) \le C\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-theorem-and-the-counterexample&quot;&gt;The theorem and the counterexample&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Väisälä proves the following theorem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem&lt;/strong&gt; Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be length spaces and \(f\colon X \to Y\) a quasi-isometric embedding.
If \(Y\) is \(\delta\)-hyperbolic, then \(X\) is \(\delta'\)-hyperbolic
for some \(\delta'\) depending only on \(\delta\) and the quasi-isometry constants for \(f\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then observes that the theorem is not true if one does not assume that \(X\) is a length space.
Here is the counterexample.
The hyperbolic space \(Y\) is the real line \(\mathbb{R}\) with the standard metric.
(Recall that \(\mathbb{R}\) is a real tree, and thus \(0\)-hyperbolic.)
The space \(X\) is the graph of the absolute value function \(\{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : y = |x| \}\)
with the Euclidean metric.
The claim is that the map \(f\colon X \to Y\) defined as \(f(x,y) = x\) is a quasi-isometric embedding,
but that \(X\) is not hyperbolic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we show that \(f\) is a quasi-isometric embedding.
Indeed, it is clear that given \(\vec x\) and \(\vec y\) in \(X\),
we have \(d_Y(f(\vec x),f(\vec y)) \le d_X(\vec x,\vec y)\).
On the other hand, note that \(d_X(\vec x,\vec y)\) is furthest from \(d_Y(f(\vec x),f(\vec y))\)
when \(\vec x\) and \(\vec y\) are in the same quadrant, where we have
\(d_X(\vec x,\vec y) = \sqrt{2}d_Y(f(\vec x),f(\vec y))\).
Thus the map \(f\) is a \((\sqrt 2,0)\)-quasi-isometric embedding, in fact a \((\sqrt 2,0)\)-quasi-isometry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we show that \(X\) is not hyperbolic.
Consider the four points \(x = (0,0)\), \(y = (-2t,2t)\), \(z = (2t,2t)\) and \(w = (t,t)\).
Then we have&lt;/p&gt;

\[(x,z)_w = \frac 12\left(\sqrt 2t + \sqrt 2t - 2\sqrt 2t\right) = 0,\]

\[(x,y)_w = \frac 12\left(\sqrt 2t + 2\sqrt 5t - 2\sqrt 2t\right) \approx 1.53t\]

\[(y,z)_w = \frac 12\left(2\sqrt 5 + \sqrt 2t - 4t\right) \approx 0.94t\]

&lt;p&gt;But observe that as \(t \to \infty\), we have that \((x,y)_w\) and \((y,z)_w\) tend to \(\infty\),
so no uniform choice of \(\delta\) makes the inequality
\((x,z)_w \ge \min\{(x,y)_w,(y,z)_w\} - \delta\) hold.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Gromov’s original definition of Gromov hyperbolicity makes sense for arbitrary metric spaces.

The purpose of this post is introduce the Farey graph
and prove a couple of basic properties of it.&lt;/p&gt;

Two vertices \(\frac{a}{b}\) and \(\frac{c}{d}\) span an edge
when the matrix \(\begin{pmatrix} a &amp;amp; c \\ b &amp;amp; d \end{pmatrix}\) has determinant \(\pm 1\).
Above is a picture; thanks to StackExchange user &lt;a href=&quot;https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/165845/212812&quot;&gt;marchetto&lt;/a&gt;
for the TikZ code for producing the Farey diagram, to which I mainly added numbers.
I’d like to demonstrate that the visual properties of the Farey graph hold:
namely, that every edge belongs to exactly two triangles,
and that edges do not cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;edges-belong-to-two-triangles&quot;&gt;Edges belong to two triangles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section we will show that every edge of the Farey graph belongs to two triangles.
The key tool will be a lemma I learned from
&lt;a href=&quot;http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/TN/TNch1.pdf&quot;&gt;Allen Hatcher’s &lt;em&gt;Topology of Numbers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lemma.&lt;/strong&gt; Suppose \(a\) and \(b\) are integers with no common divisor.
If one integral solution of \(ay - bx = n\) is \((x,y) = (c,d)\),
then the general integral solution is \((x,y) = (c + ka, d + kb)\) for integer \(k\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proof.&lt;/em&gt; Consider a general solution \((x,y)\).
Given our known solution \((c,d)\), we see that \(a(y-d) - b(x -c) = n - n = 0\).
Since \(a\) and \(b\) have no common factors, it follows that \(a\) divides \(x-c\) and \(b\) divides \(y-d\).
In fact, we have \(a(y-d) = abk = b(x-c)\), from which the result follows. \(\blacksquare\)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variant on the proof shows that if \(ac - bd = -n\), then the general integral solution for
\(ax - by = n\) is \((ka - c,kb - d)\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proposition.&lt;/strong&gt; Suppose that \(\frac ab\) and \(\frac cd\) are in the Farey graph,
and that \(ad &amp;gt; bc\). If \(\frac xy\) is adjacent to both \(\frac ab\) and \(\frac bc\),
then \(\frac xy = \frac{a\pm c}{b\pm d}\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proof.&lt;/em&gt;
Suppose \(\frac ab\) and \(\frac cd\) are as in the statement.
Now suppose \(\frac xy\) is adjacent to both \(\frac ab\) and \(\frac cd\).
Suppose first for definiteness that \(ay - bx = 1\).
By the lemma, we have that \((x,y) = (ka + c, kb + d)\) for some integer \(k\).
By assumption, we have \(cy - dx = \pm 1\), so the lemma shows that \((x,y) = (\ell c \mp a,\ell d \mp b)\)
for some integer \(\ell.\)
Therefore we have \(a(k \pm 1) = (\ell - 1)c\) and \(b(k \pm 1) = (\ell-1)d\),
from which it follows that \((k \pm 1)(\ell - 1)(ad - bc) = 0\).
Therefore either \(k = \mp 1\) or \(\ell = 1\),
both of which imply \((x,y) = (c \mp a,d \mp b)\).
If instead we have \(ay-bx = -1\), then the conclusion is the same.
We of course have \(\frac{c \mp a}{d \mp b} = \frac{a \pm c}{b \pm d}\). \(\blacksquare\)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-action-of-operatornamesl_2mathbbz&quot;&gt;The action of \(\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section we analyze the action of \(\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\) on the Farey diagram,
proving that it is transitive on edges and triangles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First let us define the action of \(\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\) on the Farey diagram.
The action of \(\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\) on \(\mathbb{Z}^2\)
restricts to an action on the vertex set of the Farey diagram.
Indeed, \(a\) and \(b\) are relatively prime if and only if there exists integers \(x\) and \(y\)
such that \(ax + by = 1\)
if and only if \((a,b)\) is the first column of a matrix in \(\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\)
if and only if there is an element of \(\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\) taking \((1,0)\) to \((a,b)\).
In terms of fractions, if \(z = \frac{p}{q}\) is a vertex of the Farey diagram,
then the action of \(\begin{pmatrix} a &amp;amp; b \\ c &amp;amp; d \end{pmatrix}\) sends \(z\) to&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{az + b}{cz + d} = \frac{ap + bq}{cp + dq}.\]

&lt;p&gt;This action preserves adjacency: the reader is encouraged to figure out why.
Indeed, the action is transitive on edges:
can you show that if \(\frac ab\) and \(\frac cd\) are adjacent in the diagram,
there is an element of \(\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\) sending the edge between \(\frac 01\) and \(\frac 10\)
to the edge between \(\frac ab\) and \(\frac cd\)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, put a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_order&quot;&gt;cyclic order&lt;/a&gt; on the vertex set of the Farey diagram
by taking the cyclic order induced by the linear order on \(\mathbb{Q} \cup \{\infty\}\).
That is, given three distinct elements \(p\), \(q\) and \(r\) in \(\mathbb{Q}\cup\infty\),
say \((p,q,r)\) is &lt;em&gt;cyclically ordered&lt;/em&gt; if
\(a &amp;lt; b &amp;lt; c\) or \(b &amp;lt; c &amp;lt; a\) or \(c &amp;lt; a &amp;lt; b\) holds.
For example \((\infty,-2,0)\) is cyclically ordered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proposition.&lt;/strong&gt; Suppose \(p\), \(q\) and \(r\) are the vertices of a triangle in the Farey diagram and that
\((p,q,r)\) is cyclically ordered.
Then there is an element of \(\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\) sending \((0,1,\infty)\) to \((p,q,r)\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proof.&lt;/em&gt;
Suppose \(p = \frac cd\) and \(r = \frac ab\).
Because \(p\) and \(r\) are adjacent in the Farey diagram,
the matrix \(\begin{pmatrix} a &amp;amp; c \\ b &amp;amp; d \end{pmatrix}\) has determinant \(\pm 1\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assume first that \(ad-bc = 1\), i.e. that \(p &amp;lt; r\).
Then the claim is that \(q = \frac{a+c}{b+d}\),
which is the image of \(\frac 11\) under the matrix \(\begin{pmatrix} a &amp;amp; c \\ b &amp;amp; d\end{pmatrix}\).
In other words, the claim is that \((p,\frac{a-c}{b-d},r)\) is not circularly ordered,
for which we need to show that \(p&amp;lt;\frac{a-c}{b-d}&amp;lt;r\) is false.
Assume first that \(b-d\) is nonnegative.
Then \(ad &amp;gt; bc\) implies \(ab - ad &amp;lt; ab - bc\), which implies \(\frac ab &amp;lt; \frac{a-c}{b-d}\), and the claim follows.
Next assume that \(b-d\) is negative.
Then \(ad &amp;gt; bc\) implies that \(ad - dc &amp;gt; bc - dc\), which implies \(\frac{a-c}{b-d} &amp;lt; \frac cd\),
and the claim follows (Note that we assume that \(d\) is nonnegative.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next assume that \(ad - bc = -1\), i.e. that \(r &amp;lt; p\).
Then the claim is that \(q = \frac{a-c}{b-d}\),
which is the image of \(\frac 11\) under the matrix \(\begin{pmatrix} a &amp;amp; - c \\ b &amp;amp; -d\end{pmatrix}\)
in \(\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\).
In other words, the claim is that \((p,\frac{a+c}{b+d},r)\) is not circularly ordered,
for which we need to show that it neither \(\frac{a+c}{b+d} &amp;lt; r &amp;lt; p\) nor \(r &amp;lt; p &amp;lt; \frac{a+c}{b+d}\) holds.
In fact, \(ad &amp;lt; bc\) implies \(ab + bc &amp;gt; ab + ad\) holds, which implies \(\frac{a+c}{b+d} &amp;gt; \frac ab\).
But, \(ad &amp;lt; bc\) implies that \(ad + dc &amp;lt; bc + dc\), which implies that \(\frac{a+c}{b+d} &amp;lt; \frac cd\),
and the claim follows. \(\blacksquare\)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the proof above shows that the matrix in \(\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\)
is unique up to multiplication of all the entries by \(-1\).
This corresponds to the matrix \(\begin{pmatrix} -1 &amp;amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp;amp; -1 \end{pmatrix}\),
which generates the &lt;em&gt;center&lt;/em&gt; of \(\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corollary.&lt;/strong&gt; The stabilizer of a triangle is isomorphic to \(C_3 \times C_2 \cong C_6\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An explicit generator for the cyclic group of order \(6\) stabilizing the triangle spanned by \((0,1,\infty)\)
is \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp;amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp;amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposition also yields an element of \(\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\) interchanging \(0\) and \(\infty\):
this element is \(\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp;amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp;amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}\).
This element is unique up to multiplication by \(-1\) and has order \(4\), so we have proven the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corollary.&lt;/strong&gt; The stabilizer of an edge is isomorphic to \(C_4\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;edges-do-not-cross&quot;&gt;Edges do not cross&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finish this post by proving that edges of the Farey diagram do not cross,
in the sense that if \(p\) and \(q\) are adjacent and \(r\) and \(s\) are adjacent
and \(p\), \(q\), \(r\) and \(s\) are all distinct,
then if \((p,r,q)\) is cyclically ordered, then \((p,s,q)\) is also cyclically ordered.
By results in the previous section, we may assume \(p = 0\) and \(q = \infty\).
That is, if \(r = \frac ab\) is positive and \(\frac cd\) is adjacent to \(\frac ab\),
then \(\frac cd\) is also positive.
By swapping the roles of \(r\) and \(s\) if necessary, we may assume that \(ad - bc = 1\).
Since we assume that \(a\), \(b\), and \(d\) are positive integers, then we must have \(c \ge 0\)
in order to satisfy \(ad -bc = 1\).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The Farey graph, or Farey diagram, is an object that appears in many guises throughout math.

with a free action on a &lt;em&gt;real tree&lt;/em&gt; is a free product of free abelian and surface groups.
The purpose of this blog post is to introduce real trees and illustrate this theorem by constructing
free actions of such groups on real trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us begin by defining real trees.
An &lt;em&gt;arc&lt;/em&gt; in a space \(X\) is an embedding \(\gamma\colon [a,b] \to X\)
of a closed interval of \(\mathbb{R}\) in \(X\).
If \((X,d)\) is a metric space,
an arc in \(X\) is a &lt;em&gt;geodesic&lt;/em&gt; if the embedding is an isometric embedding—that is,
for all \(s\) and \(t\) in \([a,b]\), we have&lt;/p&gt;

\[d(\gamma(s),\gamma(t)) = |t - s|.\]

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;real tree&lt;/em&gt; or an \(\mathbb{R}\)&lt;em&gt;-tree&lt;/em&gt; is a metric space \((T,d)\)
in which every two points are joined by a unique arc,
and this arc is the image of a geodesic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;examples-of-real-trees&quot;&gt;Examples of real trees&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see a couple of examples of real trees.
As a first example,
\(\mathbb{R}\) is a real tree.
If \(X\) is a simply connected simplicial complex of dimension \(1\),
that is, a &lt;em&gt;simplicial tree,&lt;/em&gt;
we can define a metric on \(X\)
by declaring each edge of \(X\) to be isometric to an interval of \(\mathbb{R}\) of length \(1\),
and then giving \(X\) the metric where the distance between two points is the length of a shortest path between them.
In this metric, \(X\) becomes a real tree.
The metric topology is in general strictly coarser than the simplicial topology.
This means the “identity” map from the simplicial complex \(X\) to the metric space \(X\) is continuous,
but its inverse need not be continuous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;free-abelian-groups-act-freely-on-real-trees&quot;&gt;Free abelian groups act freely on real trees&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not hard to construct free actions of finitely generated free abelian groups on real trees,
in fact the word “tree” is somewhat obfuscating:
the real tree in question is the real line \(\mathbb{R}\).
Let \(a_1,\dotsc,a_n\) be a basis for \(\mathbb{Z}^n\).
Have each \(a_i\) act by translation on \(\mathbb{R}\) by some distance \(t_i\).
If the \(t_i\) are not rationally related, then the resulting action of \(\mathbb{Z}^n\) is free.
It also has &lt;em&gt;dense orbits,&lt;/em&gt; a property of some other actions of groups on real trees
that I struggled to visualize—I find this simpler example helpful in that regard!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;surface-groups-act-freely-on-real-trees&quot;&gt;Surface groups act freely on real trees&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is admittedly more complicated.
Let \(S\) be a surface equipped with a complete Riemannian metric of constant sectional curvature \(-1\).
A &lt;em&gt;measured geodesic lamination&lt;/em&gt; \((\mathscr{L},\mu)\) on \(S\)
is a closed subset \(\mathscr{L} \subset S\) (the &lt;em&gt;lamination&lt;/em&gt;) which decomposes as a disjoint union of
complete geodesics (called &lt;em&gt;leaves&lt;/em&gt;)
together with a &lt;em&gt;transverse measure&lt;/em&gt; \(\mu\).
This is an assignment, for each arc \(c\) transverse to \(\mathscr{L}\),
of a Radon measure \(\mu|_c\) with support equal to \(c \cap \mathscr{L}\)
that is invariant under homotopy transverse to \(\mathscr{L}\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a bit of a mouthful, sorry!
A simple example of a measured geodesic lamination is just a closed geodesic \(\gamma\) on \(S\),
where the transverse measure simply counts the points of intersections of arcs \(c\) with \(\gamma\).
Notice that even if an arc \(c\) transverse to \(\gamma\) is homotopic to an arc with fewer points of intersection,
this homotopy cannot be performed transverse to \(\gamma\), so the measure is really homotopy invariant.
There are measured geodesic laminations with stranger properties
than those that come from closed geodesics,
but I think it can be helpful when trying to picture things involving geodesic laminations,
to just imagine the closed geodesic case and think of a general measured geodesic lamination
as being a sort of generalization or “limit” of this picture.
Thurston has a cute picture in his notes on the geometry and topology of 3-manifolds, see below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/geodesiclamination.png&quot; alt=&quot;Thurston's picture of a geodesic lamination&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let \((\mathscr{L},\mu)\) be a measured geodesic lamination.
We can lift it to a \(\pi_1(S)\)-invariant measured geodesic lamination \((\tilde{\mathscr{L}},\tilde\mu)\)
on the universal cover \(\tilde S\) of \(S\).
I will describe &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004093839190002L&quot;&gt;Morgan and Shalen’s&lt;/a&gt;
construction of a real tree &lt;em&gt;dual&lt;/em&gt; to \((\tilde{\mathscr{L}},\tilde\mu)\).
Since \((\tilde{\mathscr{L}},\tilde\mu)\) is \(\pi_1(S)\)-invariant,
we will obtain an action of \(\pi_1(S)\) by isometries on the dual real tree.
Let \(C\) be the set of complementary components of \(\tilde S\setminus \tilde{\mathscr{L}}\).
Given components \(c\) and \(c'\),
let \(\gamma\) be a path with one endpoint in \(c\) and the other in \(c'\)
such that \(\gamma\) is transverse to \(\tilde{\mathscr{L}}\) and intersects each leaf of \(\tilde{\mathscr{L}}\)
at most once.
For example, given a point \(x\) in \(c\) and \(y\) in \(c'\),
the path \(\gamma\) could be the unique geodesic from \(x\) to \(y\).
Define&lt;/p&gt;

\[d(c,c') = \int_\gamma d\tilde\mu.\]

&lt;p&gt;Morgan and Shalen show that this defines a well-defined distance function on \(C\),
and that this distance satisfies a \(0\)-hyperbolicity condition,
therefore there is a real tree \(T\) equipped with an isometric embedding \(C \to T\)
such that \(T\) is the smallest subtree containing the image of \(C\).
This tree \(T\) is unique up to unique isometry,
so in particular the action of \(\pi_1(S)\) on \(C\) extends to an action on \(T\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us return to our example of a measured geodesic lamination \((\mathscr{L},\mu)\),
where \(\mathscr{L}\) was a closed geodesic \(\gamma\)
and the transverse measure \(\mu\) counted intersection points.
Thinking of \(\gamma\) as an element of \(\pi_1(S)\),
the lamination \(\tilde{\mathscr{L}}\) has a leaf for each conjugate of \(\gamma\) in \(\pi_1(S)\),
and each leaf separates \(\tilde S\) into two components.
The minimal intersection number for a path joining the complementary components is \(1\),
so adjacent components are at distance one in \(T\).
In fact, if you know a little Bass–Serre theory,
the dual tree turns out to be exactly the Bass–Serre tree for the one-edge splitting of \(\pi_1(S)\)
with edge group \(\langle\gamma\rangle\), where each edge has been assigned length \(1\)!
Notice that the action of \(\pi_1(S)\) on this particular tree is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan and Shalen show that the stabilizer of a point \(p\) in \(T\) under the action of \(\pi_1(S)\)
is the stabilizer of the corresponding component of \(\tilde S \setminus \tilde{\mathscr{L}}\) if
\(p\) is in the image of \(C\), and is the stabilizer of a leaf of \(\mathscr{L}\) otherwise.
Their key result (which they prove with a Baire Category Theorem argument!)
is the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem.&lt;/strong&gt; If \(S\) is a closed hyperbolic surface that is not the connect sum of three projective planes,
there is a measured geodesic lamination \((\mathscr{L},\mu)\) on \(S\)
all of whose leaves and complementary components are simply connected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It follows that the action of \(\pi_1(S)\) on the dual tree \(T\) is free.
Morgan and Shalen also prove algebraically that if \(S\) &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the connect sum of three projective planes,
then \(\pi_1(S)\) cannot act freely on a real tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;free-products-of-groups-acting-freely&quot;&gt;Free products of groups acting freely&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the remainder of this post,
we will prove the following theorem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem.&lt;/strong&gt; If \(A\) and \(B\) are groups acting freely on real trees \(S\) and \(T\),
then there is a real tree \(X\) on which the free product \(A*B\) acts freely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If \(G\) is a finitely generated group,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grushko_theorem&quot;&gt;Grushko’s theorem&lt;/a&gt;
says that the number of factors in any free product decomposition of \(G\) is finite,
so applying the theorem inductively provides examples of free actions
of finitely generated free products of free abelian and surface groups.
(Provided, of course, that none of the surfaces in question are the projective plane,
the Klein bottle, or the connect sum of three projective planes.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proof.&lt;/em&gt; The free product \(G = A*B\) acts on a (simplicial) tree \(Y\)
with two orbits of vertices and one orbit of edges with trivial edge stabilizers.
By the orbit stabilizer theorem, the tree has the following description.
The vertex set is the union of the sets of cosets of \(A\) and \(B\) in \(G\),
and the edge set is the set of elements of \(G\).
The edge labeled \(g\) connects the vertices labeled \(gA\) and \(gB\).
Choose points \(s \in S\) and \(t \in T\).
The real tree \(X\) will be constructed in the following way.
We replace vertices of \(Y\) with copies of \(S\) or \(T\), corresponding to whether
the vertex corresponded to a coset of \(A\) or \(B\), respectively,
gluing the edges of \(Y\) so that one endpoint lies in a copy of \(S\) and the other in a copy of \(T\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explicitly the space \(X\) is the quotient of the disjoint union \(G\times S \sqcup G \times T \sqcup G\times [0,1]\)
by the following relations, where \(g \in G\), \(x \in S\), \(y \in T\), \(a \in A\) and \(b \in B\):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;\((ga,x) \sim (g,a.x)\),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;\((gb,y) \sim (g,b.y)\),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;\((g,0) \sim (g,s)\) and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;\((g,1) \sim (g,t)\).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One checks that the relations imply that there is a copy of \(S\) for each coset \(gA\) in \(G\),
a copy of \(T\) for each coset \(gB\) in \(G\),
and an edge \([0,1]\) for each element of \(G\).
Since \(Y\) was a tree, \(X\) will be a real tree.
The multiplication in the labels of the disjoint union yields an action of \(G\) on \(X\) by isometries.
There is a natural equivariant map \(X \to Y\) that collapses each copy of \(S\) and each copy of \(T\) to a point.
Each element \(g\) of \(G\) either acts freely on \(Y\) (in which case it must act freely on \(X\)),
or it stabilizes a unique vertex of \(Y\), in which case \(g\) is conjugate to an element of \(A\) or \(B\).
In this latter case, \(g\) preserves a copy of \(S\) or \(T\) 
and one checks that it acts as an element of \(A\) or \(B\).
But since the actions of \(A\) and \(B\) were free, it follows that if \(g\) is nontrivial, then it acts freely.

Here’s a short post about something cute that came up in my research this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncngt.org&quot;&gt;NCNGT&lt;/a&gt;, which has been very lovely,
my math this week has been carefully walking through a small side proposition
in a paper I’m working on with &lt;a href=&quot;http://cirget.math.uqam.ca/~tyghaswala/&quot;&gt;Ty Ghaswala&lt;/a&gt;.
The idea is that graphs of groups come with a notion of a covering space due to Bass,
and étale groupoids come with their own notion of covering spaces
(for us, we’re following the definition in Bridson–Haefliger),
and given that you can construct an étale groupoid associated to any graph of groups,
I wanted to reconcile the two notions.
The proof ends up being a story of very careful bookkeeping;
I spent much more of this week than I expected trying to gently pin down what goes where
and why and balance the sudden explosion of notation it seemed to require—not the most fun,
but so it goes. And then right at the very end I had this delightful little puzzle. Let me tell you about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I happened to be staring at the following commutative diagram of groups and homomorphisms,
all of which are injective in the particular case I was concerned with&lt;/p&gt;

\[\require{AMScd}\begin{CD}
  \mathscr{L}_{\hat e} @&amp;gt;f_{\hat e}&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \mathscr{G}_e \\
  @V\iota_{\hat e}VV @VV\operatorname{ad}(\delta_{\hat e})\iota_eV \\
  \mathscr{L}_w @&amp;gt;f_w&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \mathscr{G}_v.
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;It’s not really important what these groups &lt;em&gt;are,&lt;/em&gt;
but in case you’re curious this is a commutative diagram associated to a morphism of graphs of groups—in
my particular case, a covering map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I wanted to know, is the image of \(\mathscr{L}_e\) under these maps
equal to the intersection \(f_w(\mathscr{G}_w) \cap \operatorname{ad}(\delta_{\hat e})\iota_e(\mathscr{G}_e)\)?
Since the situation is pretty general, I wondered if there was maybe a universal property argument:
like, if in the situation above, the square is always a &lt;em&gt;pullback square,&lt;/em&gt;
then maybe we would be able to show that the two subgroups above were equal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that I had it kind of backwards:
Given injective homomorphisms \(f\colon H \to G\) and \(g\colon K \to G\), the &lt;em&gt;pullback&lt;/em&gt;
\(H\times_G K\) is (up to unique isomorphism) the intersection \(f(H) \cap g(K)\).
Recall that the pullback
is characterized by the following universal property:
it fits in the following commutative diagram&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
  H\times_G K @&amp;gt;\pi_2&amp;gt;&amp;gt; K \\
  @V\pi_1VV @VVgV \\
  H @&amp;gt;f&amp;gt;&amp;gt; G,
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;and is universal for this property in the sense that given a group \(L\)
fitting into the commutative diagram&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
  L @&amp;gt;p_2&amp;gt;&amp;gt; K \\
  @Vp_1VV @VVgV \\
  H @&amp;gt;f&amp;gt;&amp;gt; G
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;there is a unique homomorphism \(q\colon L \to H\times_GK\) such that
\(\pi_2q = p_2\) and \(\pi_1q = p_1.\)
(If there was justice and not MathJax in this world, I’d draw the full commutative diagram I’m alluding to here.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So! Assuming \(f\) and \(g\) are injective, let’s prove that \(H\times_GK\) is the intersection
\(f(H)\cap g(K)\).
This is not hard: first observe that the intersection admits maps \(\pi_1 \colon f(H)\cap g(K) \to H\)
and \(\pi_2\colon f(H)\cap g(K) \to K\):
\(\pi_1\) takes \(g \in f(H)\cap g(K)\), recognizes we can write it as \(f(\hat g)\)
for a unique \(\hat g\) in \(H\), and sends \(g\) to \(\hat g\).
Injectivity of \(f\) assures that this really defines a well-defined homomorphism,
while general properties of functions assure that \(\pi_1\) is injective.
The compositions \(f\pi_1\) and \(g\pi_2\) are the natural inclusion \(\iota\colon f(H)\cap g(K) \to G\).
The map \(\pi_2\) is defined similarly.
Next observe that any group \(L\) fitting into the commutative diagram above
clearly maps into \(f(H)\cap g(K)\), in other words,
the map \(fp_1 = gp_2\) factor through a map \(q\colon L \to f(H)\cap g(K)\) as \(\iota q\).
From here it’s not hard to argue that in fact \(\pi_1q = p_1\) and \(\pi_2q = p_2\); I’ll leave it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though in my particular situation I had the universals backwards,
I did find this realization clarifying:
it showed that to prove my result,
I needed to show that \(\mathscr{L}_e\) way up above has the universal property of the pullback,
for which it suffices to argue that given an element in the intersection
\(f_w(\mathscr{L}_w) \cap \operatorname{ad}(\delta_{\hat e})\iota_e(\mathscr{G}_e)\),
we can pull it back (as it were) and show that it really comes from an element of \(\mathscr{L}_e\).
This turned out to be true thanks to an extra property my situation enjoys!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Sometimes a pullback square is an intersection!

about Nielsen realization for infinite-type surfaces.
The format for the conference is that everyone records and uploads their talks beforehand,
and then the conference format allows for discussion and comments via Discord.
The purpose of this post is to share and talk a little bit about my talk, which is below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/QwA3bSwkcW0&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nielsen realization problem was posed by Nielsen in 1932.
The &lt;em&gt;mapping class group&lt;/em&gt; of a surface \(S\),
call it \(\operatorname{Map}(S)\),
is the group of isotopy classes of homeomorphisms of \(S\).
For a subgroup \(G\) of \(\operatorname{Map}(S)\),
it is not generally possible to realize \(G\)
as a group of honest homeomorphisms of \(S\).
Nielsen’s question was whether, in the special case that \(G\) is finite, such a realization is always possible.
Kerckhoff answered Nielsen’s question in the affirmative in 1983 for finite-type surfaces.
In fact, Kerckhoff showed the stronger result that finite subgroups of \(\operatorname{Map}(S)\)
arise as groups of isometries of hyperbolic metrics on \(S\)
(when \(S\) supports a hyperbolic metric, of course).
The first and main theorem I discuss in my talk,
which is joint work with &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/view/santanaafton/home&quot;&gt;Santana Afton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.uchicago.edu/~dannyc/&quot;&gt;Danny Calegari&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://lvzhouchen.github.io&quot;&gt;Lvzhou Chen&lt;/a&gt;,
is an extension of Kerckhoff’s result to orientable, infinite-type surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kerckhoff’s proof is very cool;
I talk through the main ideas in my talk,
but briefly he defines a \(G\)-invariant, real-valued function on the &lt;em&gt;Teichmüller space of \(S\),&lt;/em&gt;
which parametrizes (homotopy classes of) hyperbolic metrics on \(S\),
and shows that it attains a unique minimum, which is therefore fixed by \(G\).
This fixed point yields a realization of \(G\) as a group of isometries of the corresponding hyperbolic metric.
Kerckhoff’s proof does not work for infinite-type surfaces
basically because a certain finite sum in the definition of his function in the finite-type case
would need to become an infinite series,
and the obvious definition yields a divergent series.
As I mention in the talk,
I’d be very interested in talking with you
if you have ideas about how to weight this series to produce one that converges.
Instead the proof that we give involves cutting our surface up into finite-type pieces,
and applying Kerckhoff’s result to each of the pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I became interested in infinite-type surfaces and their mapping class groups
after reading a very cool (and short) &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10060&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;
of &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/view/lovingmath/home?authuser=0&quot;&gt;Marissa Kawehi Loving&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinlanier.org&quot;&gt;Justin Lanier&lt;/a&gt;
finding interesting subgroups of big mapping class groups that cannot be found in finite-type mapping class groups.
It’s a theorem that \(\operatorname{Map}(S)\) is a subgroup of the symmetric group on a countable set.
I wondered whether the symmetric group on a countable set is ever a subgroup of a big mapping class group.
The second result I discuss in the talk has the corollary that &lt;em&gt;no,&lt;/em&gt;
the symmetric group on a countable set cannot continuously embed in any big mapping class group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, after reading a draft of our paper, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.math.utah.edu/~bestvina/&quot;&gt;Mladen Bestvina&lt;/a&gt; suggested to me
that we should be able to use our techniques to prove that compact subgroups of mapping class groups are finite
and locally compact subgroups are discrete.
After a few days of thinking, I was able to find a proof!
It includes my new favorite way of proving that a group is finite:
show that it is &lt;em&gt;torsion,&lt;/em&gt; that every element has finite order,
and that it is &lt;em&gt;virtually torsion free,&lt;/em&gt; i.e. that it has a finite-index torsion-free subgroup.
Only the trivial subgroup of such a group is torsion free,
so this shows that the trivial subgroup has finite index in the whole group—so the group is finite.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’m giving a talk in Nearly Carbon Neutral Geometric Topology about Nielsen realization for infinite-type surfaces.

I’m also giving a talk in said conference,

&lt;p&gt;Let me say a little more about the space we’re talking about.
Let&lt;/p&gt;

\[F = A_1*\dotsb*A_n*F_k\]

&lt;p&gt;be a free product of the groups \(A_1,\dotsc,A_n\) with a free group of rank \(k\).
It follows from elementary Bass–Serre theory
that \(F\) acts on a (simplicial) tree \(T\) with trivial edge stabilizers
and vertex stabilizers each conjugate to some \(A_i\).
Let’s assume that the action is &lt;em&gt;minimal,&lt;/em&gt; i.e. that there is no proper invariant subtree.
Say two such trees \(S\) and \(T\) are &lt;em&gt;equivalent&lt;/em&gt; if there is an \(F\)-equivariant homeomorphism from \(S\) to \(T\).
It turns out that there are many inequivalent, minimal actions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0501288&quot;&gt;Guirardel and Levitt&lt;/a&gt; define an Outer Space to parametrize them all
(up to a finer notion of equivalence: isometry).
It is a topological space on which the group of those outer automorphisms of \(F\)
which preserve the conjugacy classes of the \(A_i\) acts.
If the \(A_i\) are &lt;em&gt;freely indecomposable,&lt;/em&gt; for example, if they are finite,
then this is all of \(\operatorname{Out}(F)\).
This Outer Space admits a &lt;em&gt;spine,&lt;/em&gt;
a subspace which is a simplicial complex
and onto which it deformation retracts \(\operatorname{Out}(F)\)-equivariantly.
Vertices of the spine are equivalence classes of minimal actions as above.
Two vertices are connected by an edge when one can be obtained from the other by collapsing an orbit of edges.
When \(n \ge 2\), the dimension of this spine is \(n + 2k - 2\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When each \(A_i\) is finite, the spine is locally finite,
and \(\operatorname{Out}(F)\) acts with finite stabilizers and finite quotient.
This is the bread-and-butter situation for geometric group theory,
so outer automorphism groups of free products of finite and cyclic groups are interesting to study as a class
because one can use the geometry of the spine of Outer Space to investigate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again by Bass–Serre theory, one can think of vertices of the spine
via their quotient graphs of groups \(\mathcal{G}\),
as is happening in the postcard.
These quotient graphs of groups will have first Betti number \(k\)
and \(n\) vertices with nontrivial vertex group each isomorphic to one of the \(A_i\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combinatorial types of the examples in the postcard play a particularly special role
in studying the spine of Outer Space.
I call vertices combinatorially equivalent to the first and last examples &lt;em&gt;thistles&lt;/em&gt;
with \(n\) prickles and \(k\) petals (here \(n = 3\) and \(k = 4\)).
Vertices combinatorially equivalent to the middle examples are &lt;em&gt;bugs&lt;/em&gt;
with a head, \(n-1\) legs and \(k\) wings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason thistles and bugs are special is illustrated in the postcard:
&lt;em&gt;collapse Whitehead moves&lt;/em&gt; along with their cousins &lt;em&gt;expand Whitehead moves,&lt;/em&gt;
form a system of paths in the spine of Outer Space that connect any two thistles to each other.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01236258&quot;&gt;Collins and Zieschang&lt;/a&gt; prove a version of Whitehead’s algorithm for free products
using in particular two families of &lt;em&gt;Whitehead automorphisms&lt;/em&gt; that they call \(S\)-Whitehead automorphisms
and \(J\)-multiple Whitehead automorphisms.
The former correspond to expand Whitehead moves, and the latter to collapse Whitehead moves,
and their result says that any two thistles in the spine of Outer Space may be connected by a path of Whitehead moves
which has a very nice interplay with a &lt;em&gt;norm&lt;/em&gt; one can put on thistles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/expandWhitehead.png&quot; alt=&quot;An expand Whitehead move&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me finish by indicating my interest in these paths:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004093839400042J&quot;&gt;Vogtmann&lt;/a&gt; proved that the outer automorphism group of a free group of rank \(k\)
is what’s called &lt;em&gt;simply connected at infinity&lt;/em&gt; for \(k \ge 5\).
Briefly, a space \(X\) is simply connected at infinity if it has one &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_(topology)&quot;&gt;end&lt;/a&gt; 
and for any compact subset \(K\),
there is a compact subset \(L\) with \(L \supset K\) such that
any loop in \(X\setminus L\) is nullhomotopic via a homotopy in \(X\setminus K\).
A group is simply connected at infinity if some (and hence any) simplicial complex
on which it acts with finite stabilizers and finite quotient is simply connected at infinity.
So \(\mathbb{R}\) has two ends, \(\mathbb{R}^2\) has one end but is not simply connected at infinity,
and \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\) is simply connected at infinity for \(n \ge 3\);
therefore \(\mathbb{Z}^n\) is simply connected at infinity for \(n \ge 3\).
Vogtmann’s proof involves a careful understanding of the combinatorics of (expand) Whitehead moves
in the spine of Outer Space (for a free group).
I’m in the early stages of working on generalizing her result to free products of finite and cyclic groups.
The general strategy of the proof will follow hers,
but already I am seeing that the presence of collapse Whitehead moves will require their own analysis to handle.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I submitted a “mathematical postcard” (see below) to the Nearly Carbon Neutral Geometric Topology conference.

and graphs of groups as étale groupoids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk comes out of joint work in progress with &lt;a href=&quot;http://cirget.math.uqam.ca/~tyghaswala/&quot;&gt;Tyrone Ghaswala&lt;/a&gt;.
It starts with us realizing that some representations of the braid group
into the automorphism group of a free group that each of us knew how to obtain by different methods
were really the same representation.
We thought that there ought to be some way to reconcile these two representations topologically
by working with the mapping class group of certain 2-dimensional orbifolds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there things got complicated: we discovered that there is a good amount of contention about what
a map of an orbifold even is.
The consensus, outside of low-dimensional topology, seems to be to work with étale groupoids,
rather than deal with orbifolds in terms of local charts.
This has the advantage of making ineffective orbifolds easier.
To wit, see the complications in the paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04439.pdf&quot;&gt;Atlases for Ineffective Orbifolds&lt;/a&gt; by Pronk, Scull and Tommasini.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within low-dimensional topology, it’s usually thought that the mapping class group
of a 2-dimensional orbifold whose underlying space is a finite-type surface 
and whose singular set is a finite collection of points
is the subgroup of the mapping class group of the surface where the singular set is marked
preserving the singular points of a given order.
One goal of our project is to reconcile these two points of view.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The purpose of this post is to share some talk notes I made on orbifolds and graphs of groups as étale groupoids.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Train Track Algorithm For Graphs Of Groups</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/12/21/The-Train-Track-Algorithm-for-Graphs-of-Groups.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Train Track Algorithm For Graphs Of Groups" /><published>2020-12-21T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-12-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/12/21/The-Train-Track-Algorithm-for-Graphs-of-Groups</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/12/21/The-Train-Track-Algorithm-for-Graphs-of-Groups.html">&lt;p&gt;Train track maps, which also come in “relative” and other flavors,
are particularly nice homotopy equivalences of graphs
used as tools to reason about outer automorphisms of free groups.
I wrote a paper extending train track maps (as well as relative train track maps and “CTs”)
to graphs of groups (with trivial edge groups for CTs).
In this post I want to talk a little about how to think about train track maps
and (“tame” in some sense) homotopy equivalences of graphs of groups more generally.
At the end of the post I talk through using the train track algorithm
to compute an example coming from a pseudo-Anosov 5-braid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;background-on-graphs-of-groups&quot;&gt;Background on graphs of groups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a little background for anyone reading who isn’t an expert in graphs of groups.
The standard reference is Chapter 1 of Serre’s book &lt;em&gt;Trees,&lt;/em&gt; 
which is terse but very good.
Group actions on trees (i.e. simply connected, 1-dimensional simplicial complexes)
crop up all over the place in the theory of infinite groups.
A &lt;em&gt;graph of groups&lt;/em&gt; is a kind of “orbifold quotient” of a group action on a tree.
Technically one needs to assume that the action satisfies the condition of
“no inversions in edges” which means what it probably sounds like
and can always be accomplished by passing to the barycentric subdivision of the tree.
Under this hypothesis, the quotient space of the action is naturally a graph
(i.e. a 1-dimensional CW complex, which will be connected).
Attached to the vertices and edges of the graph are groups
recording stabilizer information.
The “no inversions in edges” hypothesis ensures that if an edge is stabilized by a group element,
then so are the incident vertices,
so there are injective homomorphisms from edge groups into incident vertex groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you happen to like thinking categorically,
a graph of groups can be succinctly described this way.
A graph \(\Gamma\) describes a small category \(\Gamma\) whose objects are the cells of \(\Gamma\)
and whose nonidentity arrows run from edges to incident vertices.
A graph of groups is a functor from the small category \(\Gamma\)
to the category of groups with arrows monomorphisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental theorem of Bass–Serre theory asserts a perfect correspondence between
groups acting on trees on the one hand and graphs of groups on the other.
The exciting part of the theorem says that given a graph of groups,
there is a group, called the &lt;em&gt;fundamental group of the graph of groups&lt;/em&gt;
and a tree, called the &lt;em&gt;Bass–Serre tree&lt;/em&gt; on which it acts
so that the quotient graph of groups is the given graph of groups.
By the way, the fundamental group is really a group of homotopy classes of loops
in the right sense.
In the language of orbifolds, every graph of groups is “good.”
What’s more, a simple presentation of the fundamental group of the graph of groups
can be written down, and the tree and action explicitly described.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;morphisms-and-maps-of-graphs-of-groups&quot;&gt;Morphisms and maps of graphs of groups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s call a continuous map of graphs a &lt;em&gt;morphism&lt;/em&gt; if it sends vertices to vertices and edges to edges.
There is a notion, due to Bass, of a &lt;em&gt;morphism&lt;/em&gt; of graphs of groups.
It’s a little complicated, so I’d rather talk around it than give a formal definition here.
Suppose \(G\) and \(G'\) are groups acting on trees \(T\) and \(T'\), respectively,
and suppose that we have a homomorphism \(f_\sharp\colon G \to G'\).
A morphism \(\tilde f\colon T \to T'\) is &lt;em&gt;equivariant&lt;/em&gt; with respect to \(f_\sharp\) 
if for all \(g \in G\) and \(x \in T\), we have&lt;/p&gt;

\[\tilde f(g.x) = f_\sharp(g).\tilde f(x).\]

&lt;p&gt;If \(\mathcal{G}\) and \(\mathcal{G}'\) are the quotient graphs of groups,
Bass’s definition is designed so that in this situation there is a morphism \(f\colon\mathscr{G} \to \mathscr{G}'\).
Conversely, given a morphism of graphs of groups \(f\colon \mathscr{G} \to \mathscr{G}'\),
there is a map \(f_\sharp\colon G \to G'\) and an equivariant map \(\tilde f\colon T\to T'\).
The correspondence is not quite perfect—in some situations there are multiple morphisms of graphs of groups
yielding the same pair \(f_\sharp\) and \(\tilde f\),
but the difference is understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one happens to be categorically minded, it’s possible to give a succinct definition 
of a morphism of graphs of groups.
Suppose \(\mathcal{G}\) and \(\mathcal{G}'\) are graphs of groups with underlying graphs
\(\Gamma\) and \(\Gamma'\), respectively.
A morphism of graphs \(f\colon \Gamma \to \Gamma'\) yields a functor of the associated small categories.
(Indeed, one could eke out slightly more generality 
by defining morphisms of graphs to be those maps yielding a functor of small categories.)
A morphism of graphs of groups is a morphism of underlying graphs \(f\colon \Gamma \to \Gamma'\)
and a &lt;em&gt;pseudonatural transformation&lt;/em&gt; of functors \(f\colon \mathscr{G} \Rightarrow \mathscr{G}'f\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now suppose we have an automorphism \(f_\sharp\colon G \to G\) and a map
\(\tilde f \colon T \to T\) which is equivariant with respect to \(f_\sharp\) 
but may not be a morphism.
After performing a homotopy, 
we may assume that \(\tilde f\) 
is a linear embedding on each edge, 
expanding it over an edge path.
Now \(\tilde f\) will become a morphism after (equivariantly) subdividing each edge into finitely many edges,
so on the quotient graph of groups we are interested in maps 
which may be represented as a subdivision followed by a morphism.
Such a map \(f\colon \mathcal{G}\to\mathcal{G}\) sends vertices to vertices and edges to paths in the graph of groups.
If additionally the image of each edge is a &lt;em&gt;tight&lt;/em&gt; path, i.e. it cannot be shortened by a homotopy,
we’ll call such a map a &lt;em&gt;topological representative.&lt;/em&gt;
For (many) examples of this kind of map, hang on for one more section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;train-track-maps&quot;&gt;Train track maps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Train track maps were introduced by Bestvina and Handel in their 1992 paper
“Train tracks and automorphisms of free groups”
to study outer automorphisms of free groups.
They remain one of the main tools for their study.
A topological representative is a &lt;em&gt;train track map&lt;/em&gt; if for each edge \(e\),
the path \(f^k(e))\) is immersed for all \(k \ge 1\),
i.e. it cannot be shortened by a homotopy.
If one accepts immersions and homotopy in a graph of groups sense,
the same definition works for both topological representatives on graphs and on graphs of groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bestvina and Handel describe an algorithm that takes as input an arbitrary topological representative
and progressively either improves it to a train track map or finds an invariant subgraph.
(It is &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; possible to be both a train track map and have an invariant subgraph, 
but these cases are of less interest.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The argument is a beautiful application of the Perron–Frobenius theory of nonnegative integer matrices.
A nonnegative integer matrix \(M\) is &lt;em&gt;irreducible&lt;/em&gt; if for each \(i\) and \(j\) there exists \(k\)
such that the \(ij\)th entry of \(M^k\) is positive.
To a topological representative \(f\colon \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{G}\) we can associate a &lt;em&gt;transition matrix&lt;/em&gt;
with rows and columns for each edge of the underlying graph \(\Gamma\)
and \(ij\)th entry the number of times the image of the \(j\)th edge crosses the \(i\)th edge in either direction.
It turns out that the transition matrix of \(f\) is irreducible exactly when \(f\) has no invariant subgraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each irreducible matrix has a real &lt;em&gt;Perron–Frobenius eigenvalue&lt;/em&gt; \(\lambda\) satisfying \(\lambda \ge 1\).
If \(f\) is not a train track map, Bestvina and Handel argue, then the Perron–Frobenius eigenvalue may be decreased
by their algorithm.
But by arguing that the number of edges of the graphs they consider remains bounded,
the Perron–Frobenius eigenvalue can only be decreased finitely many times before reaching a minimum,
at which point a train track map is reached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-pseudo-anosov-braid-example&quot;&gt;A pseudo-Anosov braid example&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the algorithm and hopefully offer some illumination on how to think about maps of graphs of groups,
I’d like to compute a train track map for the 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0506295&quot;&gt;pseudo-Anosov 5-braid with the least dilatation,&lt;/a&gt;
\(\sigma_1\sigma_2\sigma_3\sigma_4\sigma_1\sigma_2\),
seen as an (outer) automorphism of \(W_5\), the free product of 5 copies of the cyclic group of order 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write&lt;/p&gt;

\[W_5 = \langle a_1,a_2,\dotsc,a_5 \mid a_1^2 = a_2^2 = \dotsb = a_5^2 = 1 \rangle.\]

&lt;p&gt;There is a homomorphism from the braid group \(B_n\) to \(\operatorname{Aut}(W_n)\)
sending the generator \(\sigma_i\) to the automorphism&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{cases}
a_i \mapsto a_ia_{i+1}a_i^{-1} \\
a_{i+1} \mapsto a_i \\
a_j \mapsto a_j &amp;amp; j \neq i, i+1.
\end{cases}\]

&lt;p&gt;There’s a good reason (involving orbifolds) that the homomorphism sends
pseudo-Anosov braids to (outer) automorphisms representable by irreducible train track maps,
but let us just remark that we expect our eventual train track map to have
Perron–Frobenius eigenvalue equal to the dilatation of \(\sigma_1\sigma_2\sigma_3\sigma_4\sigma_1\sigma_2\),
that is, \(\lambda \approx 1.722\), the largest root of \(x^4 - x^3 - x^2 - x + 1\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the homomorphism, the action of our element on the generators of \(W_5\) is given by&lt;/p&gt;

\[\sigma_1\sigma_2\sigma_3\sigma_4\sigma_1\sigma_2\begin{cases}
a_1 \mapsto a_1a_2a_3a_2^{-1}a_1^{-1} \\
a_2 \mapsto a_1a_2a_4a_2^{-1}a_1^{-1} \\
a_3 \mapsto a_1a_2a_1^{-1} \\
a_4 \mapsto a_1a_5a_1^{-1} \\
a_5 \mapsto a_1.
\end{cases}\]

&lt;p&gt;To start, we need a graph of groups with fundamental group \(W_5\).
It is a fact that if all edge groups in a graph of groups are trivial,
and the underlying graph is a tree,
then the fundamental group of the graph of groups is isomorphic to the free product of the vertex groups.
Thus a good candidate is the following graph of groups \(\mathcal{G}_1\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/traintrack/thistle.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A graph of groups with fundamental group $$W_5$$&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one vertex with trivial vertex group, five vertices with vertex group cyclic of order 2,
represented in the image by a number 2,
and five edges, each one connecting a vertex with nontrivial vertex group to the vertex with trivial vertex group.
Let us base the fundamental group at the center vertex with trivial vertex group.
Under our identification of this fundamental group with \(W_5\),
a generator of \(W_5\) is represented by a loop that travels out along an edge,
picks up the nontrivial element of the vertex group, and then travels back.
Thus for example \(a_2\) is represented by the loop \(\bar Ba_2B\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s introduce some notation: 
I’ll write a period for the nontrivial element of any vertex group,
and write a hat above an edge to mean traveling along the edge, 
picking up the nontrivial element of the vertex group and then traveling back.
Thus the group element \(a_1a_2a_3a_2^{-1}a_1^{-1}\) is represented in our graph of groups
by the loop \(\hat A\hat B\hat C\hat B\hat A\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may represent \(\sigma_1\sigma_1\sigma_3\sigma_4\sigma_1\sigma_2\) by the map
\(f_1\colon \mathcal{G}_1\to\mathcal{G}_1\) defined as&lt;/p&gt;

\[f_1 \begin{cases}
A \mapsto C\hat B \hat A \\
B \mapsto D\hat B \hat A \\
C \mapsto B \hat A \\
D \mapsto E \hat A \\
E \mapsto A
\end{cases}\]

&lt;p&gt;The transition matrix of \(f_1\) is&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{pmatrix}
2 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; 1 \\
2 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 \\
1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 \\
0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 \\
0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0
\end{pmatrix},\]

&lt;p&gt;whose Perron–Frobenius eigenvalue \(\lambda_1\) is the largest real root of
\(-x^5 + 4x^4 + 2x^3 + 4x + 1\) and satisfies \(\lambda_1 \approx 4.577\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we decide whether \(f_1\) is a train track map?
Since \(f_1\) sends edges to tight edge paths,
the only place where cancellation could occur is where the images of edges are joined together.
For example, in \(f_1^2(A)\), there is cancellation between \(f_1(B)\) and \(f_1(\bar A)\)
because the last edge of \(f_1(B)\), namely \(A\), is equal to the reverse of the first edge of \(f_1(\bar A)\).
Thus we know \(f_1\) is not a train track map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can formalize this as follows: a &lt;em&gt;turn&lt;/em&gt; is a pair of edges sharing a common initial vertex,
e.g. \(\{\bar A,\bar A\}\) or \(\{\bar B,\bar C\}\).
The former turn is &lt;em&gt;degenerate,&lt;/em&gt; while the latter is not.
If the vertex in question has nontrivial vertex group,
rather than just pairs of edges,
we should consider pairs of pairs consisting of an edge together with a vertex group element.
Thus at the initial vertex of the edge \(A\),
the turn \(\{.A,A\}\) is nondegenerate.
A topological representative \(f\colon \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{G}\) induces a map \(Tf\)
on the set of turns by sending \(\{E,E'\}\) to the
turn determined by the initial edges in the image of \(f(E)\) and \(f(E')\).
A turn is &lt;em&gt;illegal&lt;/em&gt; if it is eventually mapped to a degenerate turn.
In our example, every turn based at the center vertex is illegal because
each such turn is mapped to \(\{\bar A,\bar A\}\).
Thus we can say that \(f_1\) is not a train track map
because, for instance, the image of \(f_1(A)\) contains the illegal turn \(\{\bar B,\bar A\}\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve the situation, let’s &lt;em&gt;fold&lt;/em&gt; \(\bar A\) and \(\bar B\). 
They each have initial segments mapped to the path \(\hat A\hat B\),
so subdivide at the endpoint of these initial segments and then identify them to create a new edge as pictured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/traintrack/fold1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Folding the edges $$\bar A$$ and $$\bar B$$&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The correspondence \(A \leadsto A'F\) and \(B \leadsto B'F\) allows us to define
a new map on our new graph of groups \(f_2\colon \mathcal{G}_2\to \mathcal{G}_2\).
The new map admits some tightening, which yields a corresponding reduction in the Perron–Frobenius eigenvalue
\(\lambda_2\),
which is now the largest root of the polynomial \(x^6 - 2x^5 - 2x^4 - 4x^2 + 3x + 2\)
and satisfies \(\lambda_2 \approx 2.994\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/traintrack/map2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The second topological representative&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the map \(f_2\) is still not a train track map, 
since every turn based at either of the vertices with trivial vertex stabilizer is eventually mapped to
\(\{\bar F,\bar F\}\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/traintrack/turns2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The second map on turns&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s fold again, this time identifying all of \(E\) with an initial segment of \(\bar F\).
The correspondence \(F \leadsto F'E\) yields a new map \(f_3\colon \mathcal{G}_3 \to \mathcal{G}_3\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/traintrack/map3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The third topological representative&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the Perron–Frobenius eigenvalue \(\lambda_3\) is the largest root of
\(x^6 - 2x^5 - 2x^4 - 2x^3 + 5x - 2\) and satisfies \(\lambda_3 \approx 2.875\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/traintrack/turns3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The third map on turns&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still illegal turns, so let’s fold \(C\) and \(D\) with \(E\) to produce a valence-one vertex
with trivial vertex group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/traintrack/fold3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The third fold&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Folding doesn’t produce any cancellation, so the Perron–Frobenius eigenvalue is unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/traintrack/map4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The fourth and fifth maps&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The valence-one homotopy does decrease the Perron–Frobenius eigenvalue;
\(\lambda_5\) is the largest root of \(-x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x - 2\)
and satisfies \(\lambda_5 \approx 1.830\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/traintrack/turns5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The fifth map on turns&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image of \(F'\) contains the illegal turn \(\{\bar A',\bar B'\}\),
which is first mapped to \(\{\bar C',\bar D'\}\) before degenerating.
So we’ll fold \(\bar D'\) and \(\bar C'\), then \(\bar A'\) and \(\bar B'\), 
and then the interior of \(F'\) if need be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/traintrack/map6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The sixth and seventh maps&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it happens, the second fold produces nontrivial tightening;
\(\lambda_7\) is the largest root of \(-x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 - 2x^2 - 2\)
and satisfies \(\lambda_7 \approx 1.789\).
We have produced a vertex of valence two with trivial vertex group and would like to get rid of it via a homotopy.
The eigenvector coefficient of the edge \(G\) is larger than the eigenvector coefficient for \(F'\),
so we collapse \(G\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/traintrack/map8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The eighth map&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Perron–Frobenius eigenvalue \(\lambda_8\) is the largest root of
\(x^6 - x^5 - 2x^3 - x - 1\) and satisfies \(\lambda_8 \approx 1.783\).
The turn \(\{\bar E',\bar F'\}\) is illegal and in the image of \(F'\), so we fold them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/traintrack/map9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The ninth map&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Perron–Frobenius eigenvalue \(\lambda_9\) is the largest root of \(x^6 - x^5 - 2x^3 - x + 1\)
and satisfies \(\lambda_9 \approx 1.722\).
The only turns that we need to worry about in the image of edges of \(f_9\) are \(\{E',\bar F''\}\)
and \(\{\bar B'',F''\}\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/traintrack/turns9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The ninth map on turns&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, both of these turns are legal, so this is a train track map!
Indeed \(\lambda_9\) is also the largest real root of \(x^4 - x^3 - x^2 - x + 1\),
the polynomial we mentioned before in connection with \(\sigma_1\sigma_2\sigma_3\sigma_4\sigma_1\sigma_2\).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Train track maps, which also come in “relative” and other flavors, are particularly nice homotopy equivalences of graphs used as tools to reason about outer automorphisms of free groups.

cheekily playing with unhooking a signifier from what it typically signifies.
Namely, one of the (many) tricky foundational things about working with orbifolds
goes by the name “the axiom of choice is false for the category of smooth manifolds.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to misinterpret the statement is to take it literally:
as undergraduate math majors learn, the axiom of choice says that given an infinite collection of sets,
you can always choose exactly one element of each set, even if the collection is infinite.
Therefore the statement “the axiom of choice is false for the category of smooth manifolds”
could reasonably be thought to mean “given a collection of smooth manifolds,
which are in particular sets with additional structure,
it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the case that you can always choose a point in each manifold if the collection is sufficiently large.”
Of course, if we accept the axiom of choice 
(I do, since I like the 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen–Schreier_theorem#Axiomatic_foundations&quot;&gt;Nielsen–Schreier theorem&lt;/a&gt;
which says that subgroups of free groups are free), 
then this statement is nonsense: it doesn’t matter if the collection of sets is really a collection of manifolds
or a collection of the contents of various grocery stores, we can always choose one element from each.
What, then, does this statement mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, there are two statements equivalent to the axiom of choice that have category-theoretic import.
This post is primarily concerned with the latter, but the former is too cute to pass up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;every-epimorphism-splits&quot;&gt;Every Epimorphism Splits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set theory is kind of in an odd position within mathematics.
I read some complaint that most mathematicians see sets every day
and yet have never seen sets be &lt;em&gt;interesting,&lt;/em&gt; 
and so discount the possibility that set theory could be a worthwhile pursuit.
The standard formulation of set theory as a foundation for mathematics is somewhat unfortunate, too:
if we take the axioms of Zermelo–Frankel set theory too literally, then we notice that everything is a set,
even the elements of sets.
Thus nonsensical questions like “what are the elements of 6” are allowable on a technicality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned this complaint, and everything in this section, from a beautiful 8-page article by Tom Leinster called
&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.6543.pdf&quot;&gt;“Rethinking Set Theory”&lt;/a&gt; from which I’d like to quote most of the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mathematicians manipulate sets with confidence almost every day, rarely making mistakes. 
Few of us, however, could accurately quote what are often referred to as “the” axioms of set theory. 
This suggests that we all carry around with us, perhaps subconsciously, 
a reliable body of operating principles for manipulating sets. 
What if we were to take some of those principles and adopt them as our axioms instead? 
The message of this article is that this can be done, in a simple, practical way (due to Lawvere). 
The resulting axioms are ten thoroughly mundane statements about sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of these axioms, the formulation of the axiom of choice is perhaps the most devastatingly simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.&lt;/strong&gt; Every [surjective function of sets] has a right inverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see that this is really equivalent, notice that if \(p\colon S \to T\) is a surjective function of sets,
then we may identify \(S\) with the disjoint union&lt;/p&gt;

\[\coprod_{t \in T} p^{-1}(t).\]

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;right inverse&lt;/em&gt; for the function \(p\) is a function \(i \colon T \to S\)
such that \(p(i(t)) = t\) for all \(t\) in \(T\).
Notice that this means that \(i\colon T \to S\) picks out one element of \(p^{-1}(t)\) as \(t\)
varies over the elements of \(T\),
so the existence of such a function is equivalent to being able to perform choice in the sense that we said above!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This axiom can be reformulated in any category:
the correct generalization of a surjective function is called an &lt;em&gt;epimorphism;&lt;/em&gt;
for categories of “sets with additional structure” (e.g. groups, rings, manifolds) the surjective maps 
are epimorphisms, but the converse is not always true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A right inverse for an arrow \(f\colon c \to d\) makes sense in any category:
it’s an arrow \(r \colon d \to c\) such that \(fr\) is the identity arrow of \(c\).
It’s a general fact that admitting a right inverse implies that the arrow is an epimorphism,
even though we haven’t defined what that is.
In fact, for categories of “sets with additional structure” if \(f\) admits a right inverse,
then it is surjective.
We say \(f\) is a &lt;em&gt;split epimorphism&lt;/em&gt; (the name comes from “split exact sequences” of e.g. groups).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows us to cheekily reformulate the axiom of choice in any category as the following statement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Axiom of Choice for a Category:&lt;/strong&gt; every epimorphism is split.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This axiom fails for smooth manifolds:
a surjective map from the real line to the unit circle in \(\mathbb R^2\) given by sending \(x\)
to \((\cos x,\sin x)\) for instance, fails to have a right inverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-equivalent-definition-of-equivalence-of-categories&quot;&gt;An Equivalent Definition of Equivalence of Categories&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another use of the axiom of choice in category theory is the following theorem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem:&lt;/strong&gt; A functor \(F\colon C \to D\) between categories \(C\) and \(D\) is an &lt;em&gt;equivalence of categories&lt;/em&gt;
if and only if it is &lt;em&gt;fully faithful&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;essentially surjective.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the functor \(F\) is &lt;em&gt;full&lt;/em&gt; if for all objects \(c\) and \(c'\) in \(C\), the function
\(F\colon C(c,c') \to D(Fc,Fc')\) is surjective, and &lt;em&gt;faithful&lt;/em&gt; if it is injective.
So \(F\) is &lt;em&gt;fully faithful&lt;/em&gt; if it induces a bijection from the set of arrows betwwen any two objects in \(C\)
to their images in \(D\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The functor \(F\) is &lt;em&gt;essentially surjective&lt;/em&gt; if every object \(d \in D\) is isomorphic to \(Fc\) for some
\(c \in C\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally an &lt;em&gt;equivalence of categories&lt;/em&gt; is a functor \(F\colon C \to D\) such that there exists an “inverse”
functor \(G \colon D \to C\) and natural isomorphisms between the two double compositions and the
identity functors of \(C\) and \(D\), respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proof that an equivalence of categories has the above properties is fairly simple: in an alternate universe,
this blog post would give it, and show that the converse requires the axiom of choice.
Let me just content myself with pointing out that the use of the axiom of choice is to pick
a \(c\) such that \(Fc\) is isomorphic to \(d\) for all \(d \in D\).
In fact, it turns out that the theorem is &lt;em&gt;equivalent&lt;/em&gt; to the axiom of choice,
if you make the appropriate definitions of the categories involved.
(e.g. \(D\) should be an index set, and \(C\) a clever category based on a collection
of sets indexed by \(D\).)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can define (small) categories &lt;em&gt;internal&lt;/em&gt; to a category and 
do category theory in this way. Thus one way to phrase the axiom of choice for a category is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Axiom of Choice for a Category:&lt;/strong&gt; A functor between categories internal to \(C\)
is an equivalence if and only if it is fully faithful and essentially surjective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the category of smooth manifolds &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; fails this axiom,
essentially because it fails the previous one!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This is a post about one of those things that is really a case of category theory cheekily playing with unhooking a signifier from what it typically signifies.
