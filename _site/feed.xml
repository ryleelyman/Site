&lt;h2 id=&quot;atlases&quot;&gt;Atlases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will say that a stack over \(\mathbf{Top}\) “is a space” if it is isomorphic as a stack
to \(\underline{X}\) for some topological space \(X\).
Following Lerman, we will in fact just drop the underline,
thinking of \(X\) as the stack \(\underline{X}\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;em&gt;atlas&lt;/em&gt; for a stack \(\mathsf{D}\) is a space \(X\)
and a map \(p\colon X \to \mathsf{D}\)
such that for any map \(f\colon Y \to \mathsf{D}\) of a space into \(\mathsf{D}\),
the fiber product \(Y \times_{\mathsf{D}} X\) is a space
and the map \(\pi_1 \colon Y \times_{\mathsf{D}} X \to Y\)
is an open surjection which admits local sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently it is common to say in the literature 
that the map \(X \to \mathsf{D}\) is &lt;em&gt;representable.&lt;/em&gt;
We say that \(\mathsf{D}\) is a &lt;em&gt;topological stack&lt;/em&gt; if it has an atlas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;example-mathsfbmathcalg&quot;&gt;Example: \(\mathsf{B}\mathcal{G}\)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let \(\mathcal{G}\) be a topological groupoid,
and let \(\mathsf{B}\mathcal{G}\) be the category of principal \(\mathcal{G}\)-bundles
and \(\mathcal{G}\)-equivariant maps.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://ems.press/content/serial-article-files/6839&quot;&gt;Lerman&lt;/a&gt; shows that \(\mathsf{B}\mathcal{G}\) is fibered in groupoids over \(\mathbf{Top}\);
well, strictly speaking he is talking about Lie groupoids, but the argument works just fine
for spaces and topological groupoids.
In fact it is a stack: just as, you might think,
given a topological group \(G\) and a principal \(G\)-bundle on an open cover of a space \(X\)
with gluing data, you can glue up to form a principal \(G\)-bundle on \(X\),
you can do the same for groupoids,
and moreover isomorphisms form a sheaf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given a topological groupoid \(\mathcal{G}\),
we claim that the map \(p\colon \mathcal{G}_0 \to \mathsf{B}\mathcal{G}\)
defined (by the 2-Yoneda lemma) by 
the principal \(\mathcal{G}\)-bundle \(\omega\colon \mathcal{G}_1 \to \mathcal{G}_0\)
is an atlas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So given any space \(Y\) and a map \(E\colon Y \to \mathsf{B}\mathcal{G}\), 
we need to show that \(Y\times_{\mathsf{B}\mathcal{G}} \mathcal{G}_0\)
is a space.
First, note that by the 2-Yoneda lemma,
the functor \(E\) is determined by a principal \(\mathcal{G}\)-bundle \(E \to Y\).
Given a map \(g\colon Z \to Y\), the bundle \(E(g)\) is canonically isomorphic
to the pullback \(g^*E\), so to ease notation, we will assume 
that it is actually equal to \(g^*E\).
Similarly given \(f\colon Z \to \mathcal{G}_0\), we will assume
the bundle \(p(f)\) is \(f^*\mathcal{G}_1\).
Thus an object of the fiber product over a space \(Z\) is a triple
\((g,f,\beta)\)
where \(g\colon Z \to Y\) and \(f\colon Z \to \mathcal{G}_0\) are maps of spaces
and \(\beta\colon g^*E \to f^*\mathcal{G}_1\) is a \(\mathcal{G}\)-equivariant map of bundles,
hence an isomorphism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall that&lt;/p&gt;

\[f^*\mathcal{G}_1 = \{(z,h) \in Z \times \mathcal{G}_1 : f(z) = \omega(h) \}.\]

&lt;p&gt;The map \(z \mapsto (z,1_{f(z)})\) defines a global section \(\sigma\) of this bundle.
We claim that the isomorphism \(\beta^{-1}\colon f^*\mathcal{G}_1 \to g^*E\)
is determined uniquely by the image of \(\sigma\).
Indeed, given \(\beta^{-1}(\sigma(z)) = (z,e)\),
we must have \(\beta^{-1}(z,h) = \beta^{-1}(\sigma(z).h) = (z,e).h\),
for all appropriate \(h \in \mathcal{G}_1\),
so fiber by fiber the bundle map \(\beta^{-1}\) 
is determined by the point \(\beta^{-1}(\sigma(z))\).
This gives us a map \(\tau\colon Z \to E\) 
defined as \(z \mapsto e\) such that \(\pi \tau = g\),
where \(\pi\colon E \to Y\) is the defining map of the principal bundle \(E\).
Notice that the anchor map of, for instance, \(g^*E\) is
\((z,e) \mapsto a(e)\), where \(a \colon E \to \mathcal{G}_0\) is the anchor map.
We have&lt;/p&gt;

\[f = f\pi\sigma = \omega f_{\mathcal{G}_1} \sigma 
= \alpha (\cdot)^{-1} f_{\mathcal{G}_1} \sigma = \alpha f_{\mathcal{G}_1}\sigma,\]

&lt;p&gt;since \(\sigma(z) = (z,1_{f(z)})\). But then&lt;/p&gt;

\[\alpha f_{\mathcal{G}_1\sigma} = a g_E \beta^{-1} \sigma,\]

&lt;p&gt;since the isomorphism \(\beta\) intertwines the actions and thus preserves anchor maps.
Finally,&lt;/p&gt;

\[a g_E \beta^{-1} \sigma = a \tau.\]

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, given any map \(\tau \colon Z \to E\), 
we reconstruct \((g,f,\beta)\) as follows: the map \(g \colon Z \to Y\) is \(\pi\tau\),
the map \(f\) is \(a\tau\),
Finally we need a map \(\beta \colon g^*E \to f^*\mathcal{G}_1\).
By definition we have&lt;/p&gt;

\[g^*E = \{(z,e) \in Z\times E : \pi\tau(z) = \pi(e) \} \quad\text{and}\quad
f^*\mathcal{G}_1 = \{(z,h) \in Z \times \mathcal{G}_1 : a\tau(z) = \omega(h) \}.\]

&lt;p&gt;Define \(\beta(z,\tau(z)) = (z,1_{a\tau(z)})\) and extend equivariantly.
It is clear that these constructions are mutually inverse,
and we conclude that objects of the 2-fiber product are (isomorphic to) maps of spaces to \(E\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for arrows! Suppose we have an arrow \((u,v)\colon (g_1,f_1,\beta_1) \to (g_2,f_2,\beta_2)\)
over a map of spaces \(h\colon Z_1 \to Z_2\).
This is a pair of maps \(u\colon Z_1 \to Z_2\) and \(v\colon Z_1 \to Z_2\)
with the property that the following diagrams commute&lt;/p&gt;

\[\require{AMScd}\begin{CD}
Z_1 @&amp;gt;g_1&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Y \\
@VVuV @| \\
Z_2 @&amp;gt;g_2&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Y
\end{CD}\qquad\begin{CD}
Z_1 @&amp;gt;f_1&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \mathcal{G}_0 \\
@VVvV @| \\
Z_2 @&amp;gt;f_2&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \mathcal{G}_0
\end{CD}\qquad \begin{CD}
g_1^*E @&amp;gt;\beta_1&amp;gt;&amp;gt; f_1^*\mathcal{G}_1 \\
@VV\tilde uV @VV\tilde vV \\
g_2^*E @&amp;gt;\beta_2&amp;gt;&amp;gt; f_2^*\mathcal{G}_1,
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;where \(\tilde u\) and \(\tilde v\) are the unique \(\mathcal{G}\)-equivariant maps
satisfying \((g_1)_E = (g_2)_E \tilde u\) 
and \((f_1)_{\mathcal{G}_1} = (f_2)_{\mathcal{G}_1}\tilde v\).
But because each \(\beta_i\) is over the identity map of \(Z_i\),
we conclude that in fact \(u = v\).
We have&lt;/p&gt;

\[\tau_1\pi_1 = (g_1)_E \beta_1^{-1} = (g_2)_E \tilde u \beta_1^{-1}
= (g_2)_E \beta_2^{-1}\tilde v = \tau_2\pi_2 \tilde v = \tau_2 u \pi_1,\]

&lt;p&gt;so because \(\pi_1\) is an epimorphism, we conclude \(\tau_1 = \tau_2 u\).
Finally, because, for instance, \((g_1)_E(z,\tau_1(z).h) = \tau_1(z).h\)
and \((g_2)_E(z,\tau_2(z).h) = \tau_2(z).h\),
we must have \(\tilde u(z,\tau_1(z).h) = (u(z),\tau_2u(z)) = (u(z),\tau_1(z))\)
and similarly \(\tilde v(z,1_{a\tau_1(z)}) = (v(z),1_{a\tau_2(u(z))}) = (v(z),1_{a\tau_1(z)})\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, given \(u \colon Z_1 \to Z_2\) such that \(\tau_1 = \tau_2u\),
observe that \(g_1 = \pi\tau_1 = \pi\tau_2 u = g_2u\)
and \(f_2 = a\tau_1 = a\tau_2 u = f_2u\).
We have, for any \(z \in Z_1\) and appropriate \(h \in \mathcal{G}_1\),&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{gather*}
\tilde v \beta_1(z,\tau_1(z).h) = \tilde v(z,h) = (v(z),h)  = (u(z),h) \\
= \beta_2(u(z),\tau_2u(z).h) = \beta_2(u(z),\tau_1(z).h) = \beta_2\tilde u(z,\tau_1(z).h).
\end{gather*}\]

&lt;p&gt;Therefore arrows in the 2-fiber product are (isomorphic to) maps in \(\underline{E}\),
and we conclude that the 2-fiber product is the space \(E\).
The map \(\pi\colon E \to Y\) is an open surjection which admits local sections
because \(E\) is a principal \(\mathcal{G}\)-bundle.
Therefore the map \(p\colon \mathcal{G}_0 \to \mathsf{B}\mathcal{G}\) is an atlas.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The purpose of this post is to single out the topological (or geometric or Artin) stacks.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Pursued By Stacks 4: Fiber Products</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2022/05/18/Pursued-by-Stacks-4-Fiber-Products.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Pursued By Stacks 4: Fiber Products" /><published>2022-05-18T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2022-05-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2022/05/18/Pursued-by-Stacks-4:-Fiber-Products</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2022/05/18/Pursued-by-Stacks-4-Fiber-Products.html">&lt;p&gt;Okay, we’re closing in on the definition of a geometric stack over \(\mathbf{Top}\).
Actually, the nLab tells me such stacks are called &lt;em&gt;topological,&lt;/em&gt; so I’ll try and say that.
But! Before we get there, we need the construction 
of the 2-fiber product of categories fibered in groupoids over \(\mathbf{Top}\).
The purpose of this post is to discuss this construction, which I think is adorable.
I cannot shake the feeling that I’ve talked through the 2-fiber product of categories
before, but I have no idea where or why I might have done this
except possibly the last time I tried to learn about stacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friends of the blog &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/06/17/Pullbacks-and-Intersections.html&quot;&gt;will recall&lt;/a&gt; the categorical definition of a pullback.
This notion makes sense for categories (after all, categories assemble into a category),
but because of the existence of natural transformations, the universal property looks
a little bit different.
Namely, suppose we have three categories \(\mathsf{C}\), \(\mathsf{D}\) and \(\mathsf{E}\)
and two functors \(F\colon \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{E}\) and \(G\colon \mathsf{D} \to \mathsf{E}\).
The &lt;em&gt;2-fiber product&lt;/em&gt; \(\mathsf{C}\times_{\mathsf{E}} \mathsf{D}\) makes the following diagram
commute&lt;/p&gt;

\[\require{AMScd}\begin{CD}
\mathsf{C}\times_{\mathsf{E}}\mathsf{D} @&amp;gt;\pi_1&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \mathsf{C} \\
@V\pi_2VV @VFVV \\
\mathsf{D} @&amp;gt;G&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \mathsf{E}
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;up to natural isomorphism \(\eta\colon F\pi_1 \Rightarrow G\pi_2\)
and is &lt;em&gt;universal&lt;/em&gt; for this property in the following slightly complicated sense.
Given any category \(\mathsf{X}\), maps \(H\colon \mathsf{X} \to \mathsf{C}\)
and \(K\colon \mathsf{X} \to \mathsf{D}\)
with a natural isomorphism \(\epsilon \colon FH \Rightarrow GK\),
there is a functor \(P\colon\mathsf{X} \to \mathsf{C}\times_{\mathsf{E}}\mathsf{D}\)
and natural isomorphisms \(\alpha\colon H \Rightarrow \pi_1P\) 
and \(\beta\colon K\Rightarrow \pi_2P\)
with the property that \((G\beta)^{-1} \circ \eta P \circ F\alpha = \epsilon\).
This is summarized in the following diagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2pullback.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;The 2-pullback diagram&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given another functor \(Q\colon \mathsf{X} \to \mathsf{C}\times_{\mathsf{E}}\mathsf{D}\)
and natural isomorphisms \(\gamma\colon H\Rightarrow \pi_1Q\)
and \(\delta\colon K \Rightarrow \pi_2Q\) as above,
there exists a unique natural isomorphism \(\lambda \colon P \Rightarrow Q\)
with the property that \(\pi_1\lambda \colon \pi_1P \Rightarrow \pi_1Q\)
equals \(\gamma\circ\alpha^{-1}\) and \(\pi_2\lambda = \delta\circ\beta^{-1}\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of categories fibered in groupoids over \(\mathbf{Top}\),
the 2-fiber product has the following definition.
Objects of \(\mathsf{C}\times_{\mathsf{E}} \mathsf{D}\) are triples
\((c,d,\alpha)\), where \(c \in \mathsf{C}\) and \(d \in \mathsf{D}\) are objects
over the same space \(X\)
and \(\alpha\colon F(c) \to G(d)\) is an arrow over the identity map of \(X\).
Arrows of \(\mathsf{C}\times_{\mathsf{E}}\mathsf{D}\) are pairs of arrows
\(u\colon c_1 \to c_2\) and \(v\colon d_1 \to d_2\)
over the same map of spaces \(f\colon X \to Y\)
with the property that the following diagram commutes in \(\mathsf{E}\)&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
F(c_1) @&amp;gt;\alpha_1&amp;gt;&amp;gt; G(d_1) \\
@VVF(u)V @VVG(v)V \\
F(c_2) @&amp;gt;\alpha_2&amp;gt;&amp;gt; G(d_2).
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;There is an obvious functor \(\pi\colon \mathsf{C}\times_{\mathsf{E}}\mathsf{D} \to \mathbf{Top}\)
sending an object \((c,d,\alpha)\) to the space \(X\) that \(c\) and \(d\) are over
and sending an arrow \((u,v)\) to the map \(f\colon X \to Y\) that \(u\) and \(v\) are over.
We’d like to show that \(\mathsf{C}\times_{\mathsf{E}}\mathsf{D}\) is fibered in groupoids.
Given an object \(\xi = (c,d,\alpha)\) over \(X\) and a map \(f\colon Y \to X\),
we need a “pullback” \(f^*\xi\) over \(Y\).
It would be simplest to define \(f^*\xi = (f^*c,f^*d,f^*\alpha)\),
but we don’t necessarily have \(f^*F(c) = F(f^*c)\), 
merely that they are canonically isomorphic via an isomorphism 
\(\sigma_{F,f}\colon F(f^*c) \to f^*F(c)\)
such that \(F(f_c) = f_{F(c)} \sigma_{F,f}\).
So we will in fact define \(f^\xi = (f^*c, f^*d, \sigma_{G,f}^{-1} f^*\alpha \sigma_{F,f})\).
The map \(f_\xi \colon f^*\xi \to \xi\)
is the map \((f_c,f_d)\). We check&lt;/p&gt;

\[\alpha F(f_c) = \alpha f_{F(c)} \sigma_{F,f} = f_{G(d)} f^*\alpha \sigma_{F,f} 
= G(f_d) \sigma_{G,f}^{-1} f^*\alpha \sigma_{F,f},\]

&lt;p&gt;so this really does give a map \(f_\xi \colon f^*\xi \to \xi\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given a pair of arrows \((u_1,v_1)\colon (c_1,d_1,\alpha_1) \to (c,d,\alpha)\)
and \((u_2,v_2)\colon (c_2,d_2,\alpha_2) \to (c,d,\alpha)\)
over maps \(f \colon Y \to X\) and \(g\colon Z \to X\)
such that there exists a map of spaces \(h\colon Y \to Z\) with \(gh = f\),
we need a unique pair of maps \(h_{\mathsf{C}}\colon c_1 \to c_2\) and 
\(h_{\mathsf{D}}\colon d_1 \to d_2\)
such that the relevant diagram commutes.
But observe that because \(u_1\) and \(u_2\) are over \(f\) and \(g\),
there does exist a unique map \(h_{\mathsf{C}}\colon c_1 \to c_2\)
and similarly a unique map \(h_{\mathsf{D}}\colon d_1 \to d_2\) lifting the diagram \(gh = f\).
We need to check that the following diagram commutes&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
F(c_1) @&amp;gt;\alpha_1&amp;gt;&amp;gt; G(d_1) \\
@VVF(h_{\mathsf{C}})V @VVG(h_{\mathsf{D}})V \\
F(c_2) @&amp;gt;\alpha_2&amp;gt;&amp;gt; G(d_2).
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;We will show this by the strategy from the last post:
fitting both paths around the square into the vertical arrow in the following diagram&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
F(c_1) @&amp;gt;\alpha F(u_1)&amp;gt;&amp;gt; G(d) \\
@VVV @| \\
G(d_2) @&amp;gt;G(v_2)&amp;gt;&amp;gt; G(d);
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;uniqueness then assures equality of the paths around the square.
We have&lt;/p&gt;

\[\alpha F(u_1) = G(v_1)\alpha_1 = G(v_2)G(h_{\mathsf{D}})\alpha_1.\]

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand we have&lt;/p&gt;

\[\alpha F(u_1) = \alpha F(u_2)F(h_{\mathsf{C}}) = G(v_2) \alpha_2 F(h_{\mathsf{C}}),\]

&lt;p&gt;how satisfying! This shows that the 2-fiber product really is fibered in groupoids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, we have obvious projections \(\mathsf{C}\times_{\mathsf{E}}\mathsf{D}\)
to \(\mathsf{C}\) and \(\mathsf{D}\).
Call these \(\pi_1\) and \(\pi_2\).
We do not quite have \(F\pi_1 = G\pi_2\),
merely that there is a natural isomorphism \(\eta\colon F\pi_1 \Rightarrow G\pi_2\)
defined by \(\eta(c,d,\alpha) = \alpha\)! Adorable, right?
Showing that \(\eta\) really is natural is cute, but I’ll leave it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, are you still thinking vector bundles? I know I am;
it’s helpful to pretend that there really is a projection from \(\xi \in \mathsf{C}\)
down to the space \(X\) it is over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-universal-property&quot;&gt;The universal property&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to conclude this post by showing that the fiber product 
really has its universal property.
Given a category \(\mathsf{X}\) fibered in groupoids over \(\mathbf{Top}\)
with functors \(H \colon \mathsf{X} \to \mathsf{C}\) and \(K\colon \mathsf{X} \to \mathsf{D}\)
and a natural isomorphism \(\epsilon\colon FH \Rightarrow GK\),
the obvious functor \(P\) to \(\mathsf{C}\times_{\mathsf{E}}\mathsf{D}\)
is defined on objects as \(x \mapsto (H(x),K(x),\epsilon(x))\)
and on arrows \((u\colon x \to y) \mapsto (H(u),K(u))\).
Naturality of \(\epsilon\) assures that this is really a functor.
In this case, the isomorphisms \(\alpha\colon H \Rightarrow \pi_1P\) 
and \(\beta\colon K \Rightarrow \pi_2P\)
are the identity: these diagrams commute on the nose.
Now suppose we have another functor 
\(Q\colon \mathsf{X} \to \mathsf{C}\times_{\mathsf{E}}\mathsf{D}\)
and natural isomorphisms \(\gamma \colon H \Rightarrow \pi_1Q\)
and \(\delta\colon K \Rightarrow \pi_2Q\).
Define \(\lambda \colon P \Rightarrow Q\) by the rule
\(\lambda(x) = (\gamma(x),\delta(x))\colon (H(x),K(x),\epsilon(x)) \to Q(x)\).
We write \(Q(x) = (c,d,\alpha)\). We need the following diagram to commute&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
FH(x) @&amp;gt;\epsilon(x)&amp;gt;&amp;gt; GK(x) \\
@VVF\gamma(x)V @VVG\delta(x)V \\
F(c) @&amp;gt;\alpha&amp;gt;&amp;gt; G(d).
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;But this is exactly the condition at \(x\) for the equality
\((G\delta)^{-1}\eta Q F\gamma = \epsilon\),
so \(\lambda(x)\) really defines an arrow.
Given an arrow \(u\colon x \to y\) in \(\mathsf{X}\),
we need to check naturality:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
(H(x),K(x),\epsilon(x)) @&amp;gt;\lambda(x)&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Q(x) \\
@VV(H(u),K(u))V @VVQ(u)V \\
(H(y),K(y),\epsilon(y)) @&amp;gt;\lambda(y)&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Q(y).
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;This is true in each factor, for example in \(\mathsf{C}\) we have
\(\pi_1 Q(u) \gamma(x) = \gamma(y) H(u)\).
Therefore both paths around the square give equal arrows.
It is clear from the construction that \(\lambda\) is unique.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Okay, we’re closing in on the definition of a geometric stack over \(\mathbf{Top}\).

&lt;p&gt;The 2-Yoneda lemma works for categories fibered in groupoids over any category,
but to keep things hopefully slightly clearer I will continue to speak of our base category
as \(\mathbf{Top}\).
Given a space \(X\), there is a category fibered in groupoids over \(\mathbf{Top}\),
namely the &lt;em&gt;slice category&lt;/em&gt; \(\mathbf{Top}/X = \underline{X}\).
The objects of \(\underline{X}\) are maps with codomain \(X\)
and arrows are maps of the domains making the diagram below commute&lt;/p&gt;

\[\require{AMScd}\begin{CD}
Y @&amp;gt;f&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Z \\
@VVV @VVV \\
X @= X
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;where the vertical maps are the defining maps of the objects.
The projection \(\underline{X} \to \mathbf{Top}\) sends an object, which is a map \(Y \to X\)
to its domain \(Y\),
and sends an arrow to the corresponding map of domains.
Notationally, this category is very frustrating to work with,
since both objects and arrows are maps, and we’ll want to use a single map as both.
Lerman solves this problem with the power of TikZ, which we don’t have here in blog land.
I will attempt to solve this by referring to objects of \(\underline{X}\)
by their domain when I can,
and saving the maps for referring to arrows.
Thus, for example, if \(F\) is a functor with domain \(\underline{X}\),
after specifying that I am considering \(f\colon Y \to X\),
I will write \(F(Y)\) the image of \(f\colon Y \to X\) under \(F\),
and write \(F(f)\) for the image of the arrow that is secretly the following diagram&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
Y @&amp;gt;f&amp;gt;&amp;gt; X \\
@VfVV @V1_XVV \\
X @= X.
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;You see? Clear as mud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pasting Lemma from general topology, essentially,
tells us that \(\underline{X}\) is actually a stack.
(Given a map to \(X\) defined on an open cover of a space \(Y\)
with isomorphisms between double intersections 
satisfying the cocycle condition on triple intersections,
there is certainly a map \(Y \to X\), so every descent datum is effective.
What’s more, an isomorphism over \(X\) between \(Y\) and \(Y&apos;\) is definitely
determined by its restriction to an open cover, so isomorphisms form a sheaf.)
We don’t need that at the moment, but it will be useful later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall that natural transformations (necessarily isomorphisms)
between maps (functors) of categories fibered in groupoids
make the collection (ack, is it a set??)
of maps \(F\colon \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{D}\) into a category (necessarily a groupoid)
called \(\operatorname{Hom}(\mathsf{C},\mathsf{D})\).
Similarly, given a category fibered in groupoids \(\mathsf{D}\)
and a space \(X\), there is a category \(\mathsf{D}(X)\)
comprising all those objects \(\xi \in \mathsf{D}\) with \(\pi(\xi) = X\),
where arrows are arrows \(f\colon \xi \to \xi&apos;\) in \(\mathsf{D}\)
with the property that \(\pi(f) = 1_X\).
Ahh, this latter category is probably not small in general,
but maybe there are standard(?) tricks you can do to show it is equivalent to a small category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem.&lt;/strong&gt; (The 2-Yoneda Lemma)
 The functor 
 \(\operatorname{よ}\colon \operatorname{Hom}(\underline{X},\mathsf{D}) \to \mathsf{D}(X)\)
 defined on objects (functors) as 
 \((F\colon \underline{X} \to \mathsf{D}) \mapsto F(1_X\colon X \to X)\)
 and on arrows (natural transformations) as
 \((\alpha\colon F \Rightarrow G) \mapsto (\alpha(1_X)\colon F(1_X) \to G(1_X))\)
 is an equivalence of categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In more words, the functor \(\operatorname{よ}\) sends a functor \(F\) to its
action on the map \(1_X \colon X \to X\) in \(\underline{X}\)
and sends a natural transformation \(\alpha\) between functors \(F\) and \(G\)
to its action on the map \(1_X \colon X \to X\),
which happens to be (by the definition of a natural transformation)
an arrow from \(F(1_X)\) to \(G(1_X)\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proof.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
First notice that \(\operatorname{よ}(F)\) is definitely an object over \(X\),
since maps of categories fibered in groupoids preserve the projection to \(\mathbf{Top}\).
Similarly, since natural transformations are over the identity of \(\mathbf{Top}\),
\(\operatorname{よ}(\alpha)\) is definitely over \(1_X\).
Therefore the map is well-defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next observe that
\(\operatorname{よ}(1_F \colon F \Rightarrow F) = 1_F(1_X) \colon F(1_X) \to F(1_X)\)
is in fact the identity arrow of \(1_X \colon X \to X\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now suppose that we have \(\alpha\colon F \Rightarrow G\) and \(\beta\colon G \Rightarrow H\).
We have&lt;/p&gt;

\[\operatorname{よ}(\beta\alpha) = (\beta\alpha)(1_X) 
= \beta(1_X)\alpha(1_X) = \operatorname{よ}(\beta)\operatorname{よ}(\alpha)\]

&lt;p&gt;so \(\operatorname{よ}\) is indeed a functor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To show that \(\operatorname{よ}\) is an equivalence of categories we will show that
it is full, faithful and essentially surjective.
Suppose \(F\) and \(G\) are functors \(\underline{X} \to \mathsf{D}\).
Write \(X\) for the object \(1_X \colon X \to X\) in \(\underline{X}\), and
write \(F(X) = \xi\) and \(G(X) = \xi&apos;\).
Given a map of spaces \(f\colon Y \to X\),
there is by the definition of categories fibered in groupoids,
a unique isomorphism \(\sigma_{F,f}\colon F(Y) \to f^*\xi\) 
with the property that the following diagram commutes&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
F(Y) @&amp;gt;F(f)&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi \\
@V\sigma_{F,f}VV @| \\
f^*\xi @&amp;gt;f_\xi&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi.
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;There is also the pullback isomorphism \(f^*a\colon f^*\xi \to f^*\xi&apos;\).
We define the action of our putative natural transformation \(\alpha\colon F \Rightarrow G\)
as \(\alpha(Y) = \sigma_{G,f}^{-1}\circ f^*a\circ\sigma_{F,f}\).
Given another map \(g\colon Z \to X\) and an arrow \(h \colon Y \to Z\) in \(\underline{X}\),
we trace the naturality square:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
F(Y) @&amp;gt;\sigma_{G,f}^{-1}\circ f^*a\circ\sigma_{F,f}&amp;gt;&amp;gt; G(Y) \\
@VF(h)VV @VG(h)VV \\
F(Z) @&amp;gt;\sigma_{G,g}^{-1}\circ g^*a\circ\sigma_{F,g}&amp;gt;&amp;gt; G(Z).
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;We claim that both paths around the square fit into the 
unlabeled vertical arrow in the following diagram
to make it commute&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
F(Y) @&amp;gt;aF(f)&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi&apos; \\
@VVV @| \\
G(Z) @&amp;gt;G(g)&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi&apos;.
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, we have&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{gather*}aF(f) = af_\xi\sigma_{F,f} = f_{\xi&apos;}f^*a\sigma_{F,f} 
= G(f)\sigma_{G,f}^{-1} f^*a \sigma_{F,f} \\
= G(g) \circ G(h) \sigma_{G,f}^{-1} f^*a \sigma_{F,f}.
\end{gather*}\]

&lt;p&gt;But on the other hand, we also have&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{gather*}
aF(f) = a F(g)F(h) = ag_\xi \sigma_{F,g} F(h) = g_{\xi&apos;} g^*a \sigma_{F,g} F(h) \\
= G(g) \circ \sigma_{G,g}^{-1} g^*a \sigma_{F,g} F(h).
\end{gather*}\]

&lt;p&gt;The argument is summarized in the following rather pretty commutative diagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/cfgdiagram.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;The argument above summarized in diagram form&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It follows by properties of categories fibered in groupoids that the naturality square commutes.
This proves that \(\operatorname{よ}\) is full.
In fact it is faithful as well, since the arrow \(\alpha(Y)\) 
is uniquely determined by \(Y\) (really \(f\colon Y \to X\)) and \(a\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To complete the proof, we show essential surjectivity.
Suppose \(\xi\) is an object over \(X\) in \(\mathsf{D}\).
We need to show that there is a functor \(F \colon \underline{X} \to \mathsf{D}\)
and an isomorphism \(\xi \to \operatorname{よ}(F) = F(X)\).
We will do one better:
define \(F(X) = \xi\) and given a map \(f\colon Y \to X\), define \(F(Y) = f^*\xi\).
Given an arrow \(h \colon Y \to Z\) over \(X\), (where again we have \(g\colon Z \to X\))
there is by the definition of a category fibered in groupoids
a unique arrow \(F(h) \colon f^*\xi \to g^*\xi\)
making the following diagram commute&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
f^*\xi @&amp;gt;f_\xi&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi \\
@VF(h)VV @| \\
g^*\xi @&amp;gt;g_\xi&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;over the map \(h\colon Y \to Z\).
Functoriality of \(F\) follows by uniqueness.
Thus \(\xi\) is &lt;em&gt;equal&lt;/em&gt; to the image of \(1_X\colon X \to X\) under some functor,
hence certainly isomorphic to it. \(\blacksquare\)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">In the previous two posts we met stacks for the first time.

and orbifolds as (being represented by) étale groupoids.
In view of &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/05/15/More-Maps-Lerman&apos;s-Critique.html&quot;&gt;Lerman’s critique&lt;/a&gt;, to which his answer is the category of geometric stacks over manifolds,
I thought it might be relevant to try and understand what a stack is.
This is the first in what will likely be several posts towards understanding the definition of a stack;
this one is focused on the concept of a &lt;em&gt;category fibered in groupoids.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;categories-fibered-in-groupoids&quot;&gt;Categories fibered in groupoids&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let \(\mathbf{Top}\) denote the category of compactly generated topological spaces and continuous maps.
(All spaces I tend to think about are compactly generated, being either manifolds or CW complexes,
so this is not a serious restriction for me.
That being said, I don’t immediately understand the desire to restrict to compactly generated spaces,
because my algebraic topology is not strong in that direction.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A functor \(\pi \colon \mathsf{C} \to \mathbf{Top}\) 
is a &lt;em&gt;category fibered in groupoids over \(\mathbf{Top}\)&lt;/em&gt;
if the following conditions hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Given a continuous map \(f\colon X \to Y\) and an object \(\xi \in \mathsf{C}\)
  with \(\pi(\xi) = Y\),
  there is an arrow \(\tilde f \colon \zeta \to \xi\) in \(\mathsf{C}\) such that
  \(\pi(\tilde f) = f\).
  Apparently we are supposed to think of \(\zeta\) as a &lt;em&gt;pullback&lt;/em&gt; of \(\xi\) along \(f\).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Given a diagram of the following form&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

\[\require{AMScd}\begin{CD}
        \xi&apos;&apos; @&amp;gt;f&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi \\
        @. @| \\
        \xi&apos; @&amp;gt;h&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;in \(\mathsf{C}\) such that there exists a continuous map \(g\colon \pi(\xi&apos;&apos;) \to \pi(\xi&apos;)\)
making the following diagram commute&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
    \pi(\xi&apos;&apos;) @&amp;gt;\pi(f)&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \pi(\xi) \\
    @VgVV @| \\
    \pi(\xi&apos;) @&amp;gt;\pi(h)&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \pi(\xi),
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;There exists a unique arrow \(\tilde g\colon \xi&apos;&apos; \to \xi&apos;\)
such that \(h\tilde g = f\) and \(\pi(\tilde g) = g\).
In other words, there is a unique way to lift the map \(g\) to make the diagram commute in \(\mathsf{C}\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In understanding stacks, I’m trying to follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://ems.press/content/serial-article-files/6839&quot;&gt;Lerman’s paper&lt;/a&gt; 
and also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/~rehmann/ECM/cdrom/3ecm/pdfs/pant3/fantechi.pdf&quot;&gt;Fantechi’s survey paper&lt;/a&gt;, so there are two main examples:
Lerman gives the example of the category \(\mathsf{B}\mathcal{G}\) of principal \(\mathcal{G}\)-bundles
with arrows \(\mathcal{G}\)-equivariant maps.
Fantechi gives the example of vector bundles of rank \(r\) and bundle isomorphisms.
I’ll give Fantechi’s example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;example-vector-bundles-of-constant-rank&quot;&gt;Example: Vector bundles of constant rank&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall that a &lt;em&gt;vector bundle of rank \(r\)&lt;/em&gt; over a topological space \(X\)
is a space \(E\) equipped with a continuous surjection \(\pi\colon E \to X\)
such that for each point \(x \in X\), the space \(\pi^{-1}(x)\) is a real vector space of dimension \(r\)
and such that for each \(x \in X\), there exists an open neighborhood \(U\) of \(x\)
and a homeomorphism \(\varphi\cong U\times \mathbb{R}^r \to \pi^{-1}(U)\)
with the property that \(\pi\varphi(y,\vec v) = y\)
and the property that the map \(\vec v \mapsto \varphi(y,\vec v)\) is a linear isomorphism
from \(\mathbb{R}^r\) to \(\pi^{-1}(y)\)
for all \(y \in U\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a category \(\mathsf{Vect}_r\) of rank-\(r\) vector bundles
where the arrows are &lt;em&gt;vector bundle maps of rank \(r\):&lt;/em&gt; commutative diagrams of the form&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
E_1 @&amp;gt;\tilde f&amp;gt;&amp;gt; E_2 \\
@VV\pi_1V @VV\pi_2V \\
X_1 @&amp;gt;f&amp;gt;&amp;gt; X_2
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;with the property that each map \(\pi_1^{-1}(x) \to \pi_2^{-1}(f(x))\) is a linear isomorphism of vector spaces.
We will abuse notation, writing \(\tilde f\colon E_1 \to E_2\) to mean the bundle map above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The claim is that the functor (also called \(\pi\)) 
sending a rank-\(r\) vector bundle \(\pi\colon E \to X\) to its base \(X\)
defines a category fibered in groupoids over \(\mathbf{Top}\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see this, suppose that \(\pi\colon E \to X\) is a vector bundle and \(f\colon Y \to X\) is a continuous map.
We need a pullback \(\tilde f \colon \xi \to E\) for some vector bundle \(\xi\) over \(Y\).
Let us take the literal pullback, that is,&lt;/p&gt;

\[\xi = \{ (y,e) \in Y \times E : f(y) = \pi(e) \}\]

&lt;p&gt;There is an obvious projection \(\pi\colon \xi \to Y\) given by projection to the first factor.
Given \(x \in X\), let \(U\) be the neighborhood of \(x\) 
with the homeomorphism \(\varphi \colon U \times \mathbb{R}^r \to \pi^{-1}(U)\).
Write \(V = f^{-1}(U)\) and define
\(\psi\colon V \times \mathbb{R}^r \to \pi^{-1}(V)\) by the rule&lt;/p&gt;

\[\psi(y,\vec v) = (y,(\varphi(f(y),\vec v)).\]

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that \(\pi\psi(y,\vec v) = y\) for all \(y \in V\).
Conversely, given \((y,e) \in \pi^{-1}(V)\), note that \(\varphi^{-1}(e) = (f(y),\vec v)\) 
for some \(\vec v \in \mathbb{R}^r\);
put another way, the map \((y,e) \mapsto (y,\vec v)\), where \(\vec v\) is the \(\mathbb{R}^r\) component
of \(\varphi^{-1}(e)\), is an inverse homeomorphism for \(\psi\).
The map \(\vec v \mapsto \psi(y,\vec v)\) is a linear isomorphism because \(\vec v \mapsto \varphi(f(y),\vec v)\)
is a linear isomorphism.
Therefore \(\xi\) is a rank-\(r\) vector bundle over \(Y\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a map \(\tilde f \colon \xi \to E\) given by projection to the second factor.
The map \(\pi^{-1}(y) \to \pi^{-1}(f(y))\) given by \((y, e) \mapsto e\) is a linear isomorphism.
To see this, note that we have the following commutative diagram&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
\pi^{-1}(y) @&amp;gt;f&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \pi^{-1}(f(y)) \\
@A\psi AA @A\varphi AA \\
\mathbb{R}^r @= \mathbb{R}^r
\end{CD}
\qquad
\begin{CD}
\psi(y,\vec v) @&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \varphi(f(y),\vec v) \\
@AAA @AAA \\
\vec v @= \vec v
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;and the vertical maps are isomorphisms.
Therefore the map \(\tilde f\colon \xi \to E\) is an arrow of \(\mathsf{Vect}_r\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given maps of vector bundles \(\tilde f\colon \xi&apos;&apos; \to \xi\) and \(\tilde h\colon \xi&apos; \to \xi\)
such that there exists a continuous map \(g \colon \pi(\xi&apos;&apos;) \to \pi(x&apos;)\) making the following diagram commute&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
\pi(\xi&apos;&apos;) @&amp;gt;f&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \pi(\xi) \\
@VVgV @| \\
\pi(\xi&apos;) @&amp;gt;h&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \pi(\xi),
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;we claim that there is a unique bundle map \(\tilde g\colon \xi&apos;&apos; \to \xi&apos;\) making the appropriate diagram commute.
Given \(x \in \pi(\xi&apos;&apos;)\), note that \(\tilde f\) and \(\tilde g\)
induce linear isomorphisms \(\pi^{-1}(x) \to \pi^{-1}(f(x))\) and 
\(\pi^{-1}(g(x)) \to \pi^{-1}(hg(x)) = \pi^{-1}(f(x))\).
Call these isomorphisms \(f_x\) and \(h_{g(x)}\).
Therefore define \(\tilde g\) as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\(\tilde g(\tilde x) = h_{g(\pi(\tilde x))}^{-1}f_{\pi(\tilde x)}(\tilde x)\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that \(\tilde g\) is a bundle map making the relevant diagram commute
and that conversely \(\tilde g\) is the only definition we could have made.
Therefore \(\mathsf{Vect}_r\) defines a category fibered in groupoids over \(\mathbf{Top}\).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’ve spent the past couple years on and off understanding how to think of graphs of groups and orbifolds as (being represented by) étale groupoids.

The stacks we’re interested in are &lt;em&gt;geometric&lt;/em&gt; stacks, so this won’t be the last post on stacks,
but with any luck we’ll see the definition in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let \(\mathsf{C}\) be a category fibered in groupoids over \(\mathbf{Top}\).
We say an object \(\xi \in \mathsf{C}\) is &lt;em&gt;over&lt;/em&gt; a space \(X\)
if \(\pi(\xi) = X\).
Both Lerman and Fantechi adopt the following convention:
for every continuous map \(f\colon Y \to X\) and every object \(\xi\) over \(X\),
we choose a lift \(f_\xi \colon f^*\xi \to \xi\)
that we call “the” pullback of \(\xi\) along \(f\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that if we had another choice \(f&apos;\colon \xi&apos; \to \xi\) of pullback,
then in \(\mathbf{Top}\) we have the following rather silly commutative diagram&lt;/p&gt;

\[\require{AMScd}\begin{CD}
Y @&amp;gt;f&amp;gt;&amp;gt; X \\
@| @| \\
Y @&amp;gt;f&amp;gt;&amp;gt; X,
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;so by the second item in the definition of a category fibered in groupoids,
there are unique maps \(g\colon f^*\xi \to \xi&apos;\) and \(g&apos;\colon \xi&apos; \to f^*\xi\)
such that, for example, the following diagram commutes&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
f^*\xi @&amp;gt;f_\xi&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi \\
@VgVV @| \\
\xi&apos; @&amp;gt;f&apos;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi.
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;It’s not hard to see that \(g\) and \(g&apos;\) are therefore inverse isomorphisms.
By the way, if \(f\) is the identity of \(X\), we see that this argument implies that
the category of objects above \(X\) is a groupoid: every arrow is an isomorphism.
Hence the name, I suppose.
In fact, if \(f\colon Y \to X\) is a continuous map
and \(\alpha\colon \xi \to \xi&apos;\) is an arrow (necessarily an isomorphism)
of objects over \(X\), a clever application of the second item again shows that
there is a unique isomorphism \(f^*\alpha\colon f^*\xi \to f^*\xi&apos;\)
such that the following diagram commutes&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
f^*\xi @&amp;gt;f_\xi&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi \\
@VVf^*\alpha V @VV\alpha V \\
f^*\xi&apos; @&amp;gt;f_{\xi&apos;}&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi&apos;.
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;Notice as well that we do not require (and probably cannot in general)
that \(g^*f^*\xi = (fg)^*\xi\), merely that they are canonically isomorphic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;descent-data&quot;&gt;Descent data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of descent is that given, say, a vector bundle defined 
open set by open set on a space \(X\)
satisfying certain gluing conditions,
this data &lt;em&gt;descends&lt;/em&gt; to a vector bundle on \(X\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More formally, let \(\mathcal{U} = \{U_i\}_{i\in I}\) be an open cover of \(X\),
and for each \(i\), let \(\iota_i \colon U_i \to X\) be the inclusion.
We have inclusions \(\iota_{ji}\colon (U_j \cap U_i) \to U_j\)
and \(\iota_{ij}\colon (U_j \cap U_i) \to U_i\) for each double intersection
and \(\iota^i_{ijk}\), \(\iota^j_{ijk}\) and \(\iota^k_{ijk}\) for inclusions from the triple
intersection \(U_i \cap U_j \cap U_k\) to the various double intersections,
where the superscript indicates the omitted subscript in the target of the inclusion.
A &lt;em&gt;descent datum&lt;/em&gt; for \(\mathsf{C}\) over \(X\) is the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An object \(\xi_i\) over \(U_i\) for each \(i\).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For each pair \(i\) and \(j\), an isomorphism 
\(\alpha_{ji} \colon \iota_{ij}^*\xi_i \to \iota_{ji}^*\xi_j\)
in the fiber over \(U_i \cap U_j\).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The isomorphisms above satisfy the &lt;em&gt;cocycle condition&lt;/em&gt;
(so named for reasons of Čech cohomology probably, so way over my head)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

\[(\iota_{ijk}^j)^*\alpha_{ki} = (\iota_{ijk}^i)^*\alpha_{kj} \circ (\iota_{ijk}^k)^*\alpha_{ji}\]

&lt;p&gt;The descent datum is &lt;em&gt;effective&lt;/em&gt; if there exists an object \(\xi\) over \(X\)
with isomorphisms \(\alpha_i \colon \iota_i^*\xi \to \xi_i\) in the fiber over \(U_i\)
with the property that \(\alpha_{ji} = \iota_{ji}^*\alpha_j\circ (\iota_{ij}^*\alpha_i)^{-1}\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In plainer words, a &lt;em&gt;descent datum&lt;/em&gt; is that open set by open set construction 
of something you’d like to exist in \(\mathsf{C}\),
and saying that the descent datum is &lt;em&gt;effective&lt;/em&gt; says that the wished-for object really exists
and is moreover obtained by gluing together it patch by patch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we say that &lt;em&gt;isomorphisms are a sheaf&lt;/em&gt; for \(\mathsf{C}\) if,
roughly, isomorphisms between elements of \(\mathsf{C}\) over any space \(X\)
are determined uniquely by their restriction to any open cover of \(X\).
More formally,
we require that for any space \(X\), 
every pair of objects \(\xi\) and \(\xi&apos;\) in the fiber over \(X\),
every open cover \(\{U_i\}_{i \in I}\) of \(X\)
and every collection of isomorphisms \(\alpha_i\colon \iota_i^*\xi \to \iota_i^*\xi&apos;\)
with the property that \(\iota_{ij}^*\alpha_i = \iota_{ji}^*\alpha_j\)
on \(U_i \cap U_j\),
there exists a unique isomorphism \(\alpha\colon \xi \to \xi&apos;\)
such that \(\iota_i^*\alpha = \alpha_i\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our category fibered in groupoids \(\mathsf{C}\) is a &lt;em&gt;stack&lt;/em&gt;
if isomorphisms are a sheaf and every descent datum is effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A map of stacks \(\mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{D}\) over \(\mathbf{Top}\) is a functor
\(F\colon \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{D}\) with the property that
\(\pi F = \pi\), where we abuse notation by writing both \(\pi\colon \mathsf{C} \to \mathbf{Top}\)
and \(\pi\colon \mathsf{D} \to \mathbf{Top}\).
A &lt;em&gt;natural transformation&lt;/em&gt; of maps \(F\), \(G\colon \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{D}\)
is a natural transformation \(\eta\colon F \Rightarrow G\)
with the property that for each \(\xi \in \mathsf{C}\),
we have \(\pi(\eta_\xi) = 1_{\pi(\xi)}\).
Notice that because \(F\xi\) and \(G\xi\) are in the fiber over \(\pi(\xi)\),
the map \(\eta_\xi\) is automatically an isomorphism,
so all natural transformations are natural isomorphisms.
An &lt;em&gt;isomorphism&lt;/em&gt; of stacks is an equivalence of categories over \(\mathbf{Top}\),
i.e. \(F\colon \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{D}\) is full, faithful and essentially surjective.
Since we love the &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/08/02/The-Axiom-of-Choice-is-False-for-Manifolds.html&quot;&gt;axiom of choice&lt;/a&gt; around here,
this is equivalent to the existence of an inverse functor up to natural isomorphism.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">A stack, so I’m told, is a category fibered in groupoids satisfying some extra conditions.

We follow the notation for étale groupoids established in the &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/05/14/Graphs-of-groups-as-%C3%A9tale-groupoids.html&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;functors&quot;&gt;Functors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If \(\mathcal{G}\) and \(\mathcal{H}\) are étale groupoids,
which are in particular &lt;em&gt;categories,&lt;/em&gt; a natural class of maps of étale groupoids to consider would be
the &lt;em&gt;continuous functors.&lt;/em&gt;
A functor \(f\colon \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{H}\) is a pair of maps
\(f_0\colon \mathcal{G}_0 \to \mathcal{H}_0\) and \(f_1\colon \mathcal{G}_1 \to \mathcal{H}_1\)
that commute with the various structure maps.
So for example we have \(\alpha f_1 = f_0 \alpha\) and \(\omega f_1 = f_0 \omega\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;example-refinement-groupoids&quot;&gt;Example: Refinement groupoids&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given an étale groupoid \(\mathcal{G}\) and an open cover 
\(\mathcal{U} = \{ U_i \}_{i \in I}\) of \(\mathcal{G}_0\),
we construct a &lt;em&gt;refinement groupoid&lt;/em&gt; \(\mathcal{G}^{\mathcal{U}}\) and a functor
\(\pi^{\mathcal{U}}\colon \mathcal{G}^{\mathcal{U}} \to \mathcal{G}\).
The space of objects is the disjoint union \(\coprod_{i\in I} U_i\).
For \(x \in U_i\), write the corresponding object of \(\mathcal{G}^{\mathcal{U}}\) as \(x_i\).
The space of arrows \(\mathcal{G}^{\mathcal{U}}_1\) is the set&lt;/p&gt;

\[\{f_{j,i} \colon x_i \to y_j : f\colon x \to y \in \mathcal{G}_1\}.\]

&lt;p&gt;A basic open set for the topology on \(\mathcal{G}^{\mathcal{U}}_1\) is of the form \(V_{j,i}\)
where \(V\subset \mathcal{G}_1\) is an open set
and \(V_{j,i} = \{f_{j,i} \colon f \in V\}\).
The functor \(\pi^{\mathcal{U}}\) is defined on objects as \(\pi^{\mathcal{U}}_0(x_i) = x\)
and \(\pi^{\mathcal{U}}_1(f_{j,i}) = f\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all functors, \(\pi^{\mathcal{U}}\) induces a continuous map of orbit spaces
\(\overline{\pi^{\mathcal{U}}}\colon \mathcal{G}^{\mathcal{U}}_1\backslash\mathcal{G}^{\mathcal{U}}_0 
\to \mathcal{G}_1\backslash\mathcal{G}_0\)
and for each point \(x \in \mathcal{G}^{\mathcal{U}}_0\), a homomorphism of isotropy groups
\(\pi^{\mathcal{U}}_x \colon \mathcal{G}^{\mathcal{U}}_x \to \mathcal{G}_{\pi^{\mathcal{U}}_0(x)}\).
The functor \(\pi^{\mathcal{U}}\) is an &lt;em&gt;equivalence&lt;/em&gt; in the sense that
the map \(\pi_0^{\mathcal{U}}\) is étale, the map \(\overline{\pi^{\mathcal{U}}}\) is a homeomorphism
and each \(\pi^{\mathcal{U}}_x\) is an isomorphism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can show that in fact \(\pi^{\mathcal{U}}\)
is an &lt;em&gt;equivalence of categories&lt;/em&gt; in the sense that it is &lt;em&gt;full, faithful&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;essentially surjective.&lt;/em&gt;
Here &lt;em&gt;full&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;faithful&lt;/em&gt; refer to the fact that for every pair of objects \(x\) and \(y\)
in \(\mathcal{G}^{\mathcal{U}}\), the map of sets&lt;/p&gt;

\[\{f\colon x \to y\} \to \{f\colon \pi^{\mathcal{U}}_0(x) \to \pi^{\mathcal{U}}_0(y)\}\]

&lt;p&gt;is surjective and injective, respectively.
(This is packaged up in the fact that the map of orbit spaces is injective and that the maps on isotropy groups
are isomorphisms.)
&lt;em&gt;Essentially surjective&lt;/em&gt; means that every object in \(\mathcal{G}\) is isomorphic
to an object in the image of \(\pi^{\mathcal{U}}\).
(This is packaged up in the fact that the map of orbit spaces is surjective.)
You should probably think of the étale condition on \(\pi^{\mathcal{U}}_0\)
as being the extra sauce that distinguishes a continuous bijection from a homeomorphism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice, however, that \(\pi^{\mathcal{U}}\) typically fails to have an inverse functor,
even up to natural transformation (about which more in a second).
I talked a little about this failure &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/08/02/The-Axiom-of-Choice-is-False-for-Manifolds.html&quot;&gt;a long time ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose the open cover \(\mathcal{V} = \{V_j\}_{j \in J}\) is a refinement of the open cover \(\mathcal{U}\),
in the sense that for each \(j \in J\),
there exists \(i \in I\) such that \(V_j \subset U_i\).
A choice for each \(j\) of \(\varphi(j) \in I\) with this property
defines a &lt;em&gt;refinement function&lt;/em&gt; \(\varphi \colon J \to I\).
Associated to the choice of \(\varphi\), there is a continuous functor 
\(\pi^{\varphi}\colon \mathcal{G}^{\mathcal{V}} \to \mathcal{G}^{\mathcal{U}}\)
defined on objects as \(\pi^\varphi(x_j) = x_{\varphi(j)}\) and on arrows as
\(\pi^{\varphi}(f_{j,i}) = f_{\varphi(j),\varphi(i)}\).
This functor is also an equivalence and satisfies \(\pi^{\mathcal{U}}\pi^\varphi = \pi^{\mathcal{V}}\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;natural-transformations&quot;&gt;Natural transformations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;natural transformation&lt;/em&gt; \(\eta\colon \phi \Rightarrow \psi\) of (continuous) functors
\(\phi\), \(\psi\colon \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{H}\) is a continuous map
\(\eta\colon \mathcal{G}_0 \to \mathcal{H}_1\) such that for each arrow \(f\colon x \to y\)
in \(\mathcal{G}\), we have \(\eta(y)\circ \phi(f) = \psi(f) \circ \eta(x)\).
(There’s a commutative square I’m deciding to omit. 
Drawing it yourself when demonstrating naturality is very instructive.)
Notice that because all arrows in groupoids are invertible,
\(\eta\) is automatically a &lt;em&gt;natural isomorphism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given two refinement functions \(\varphi\), \(\varphi&apos;\colon J \to I\),
there is a natural transformation \(\eta\colon \pi^{\varphi} \Rightarrow \pi^{\varphi&apos;}\)
defined as \(\eta(x_j) = (1_x)_{\varphi&apos;(j),\varphi(j)}\).
It’s not too hard to see that this is continuous because the assignment \(x \mapsto 1_x\) is continuous,
and for each arrow \(f_{j,i} \colon x_i \to y_j\) in \(\mathcal{G}^{\mathcal{V}}\)
the following diagram commutes&lt;/p&gt;

\[\require{AMScd}\begin{CD}
    x_{\varphi(i)} @&amp;gt;{(1_x)_{\varphi&apos;(i),\varphi(i)}}&amp;gt;&amp;gt; x_{\varphi&apos;(i)} \\
    @VV{f_{\varphi(j),\varphi(i)}}V @VV{f_{\varphi&apos;(j),\varphi&apos;(i)}}V \\
    y_{\varphi(j)} @&amp;gt;{(1_y)_{\varphi&apos;(j),\varphi(j)}}&amp;gt;&amp;gt; y_{\varphi&apos;(j)}
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;because \(1_yf = f 1_x\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;localizing&quot;&gt;Localizing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given a category \(C\) with a class of arrows \(W\) satisfying &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/calculus+of+fractions&quot;&gt;certain conditions&lt;/a&gt;
satisfied by the class of equivalences of étale groupoids
one can construct a (relatively nice) category \(C[W^{-1}]\)
in which the arrows are &lt;em&gt;spans&lt;/em&gt; of the form \(\begin{CD}x @&amp;lt;w&amp;lt;&amp;lt; y @&amp;gt;f&amp;gt;&amp;gt; z\end{CD}\),
where \(w \in W\).
Moerdijk constructed this localization for étale groupoids
after first identifying two functors if they differ by a natural transformation.
A &lt;em&gt;generalized map&lt;/em&gt; of étale groupoids is a map of this form.
Two groupoids \(\mathcal{G}\) and \(\mathcal{H}\) are &lt;em&gt;Morita equivalent&lt;/em&gt; if there is a groupoid \(\mathcal{K}\)
and equivalences \(\mathcal{K} \to \mathcal{G}\) and \(\mathcal{K} \to \mathcal{H}\).
Morita equivalent groupoids become isomorphic in Moerdijk’s localization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;maps-using-refinement-groupoids&quot;&gt;Maps using refinement groupoids&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More concretely, I prefer the following approach.
A &lt;em&gt;map&lt;/em&gt; of étale groupoids \(f\colon \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{H}\) is a functor
\(\mathcal{f}^{\mathcal{U}} \colon \mathcal{G}^{\mathcal{U}} \to \mathcal{H}\),
where \(\mathcal{G}^{\mathcal{U}}\) is a refinement groupoid of \(\mathcal{G}\).
Two functors \(\phi\colon \mathcal{G}^{\mathcal{U}} \to \mathcal{H}\) 
and \(\psi\colon \mathcal{G}^{\mathcal{V}} \to \mathcal{H}\)
&lt;em&gt;define the same generalized map&lt;/em&gt; if there exists a common refinement 
\(\mathcal{W}\) of \(\mathcal{U}\) and \(\mathcal{V}\)
such that for some (and hence any) choice of refinement functions \(\varphi\colon \mathcal{W} \to \mathcal{U}\)
and \(\varphi&apos;\colon \mathcal{W} \to \mathcal{V}\),
the following diagram commutes up to a natural transformation 
\(\eta\colon \phi\pi^{\varphi} \Rightarrow \psi\pi^{\varphi&apos;}\)&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
\mathcal{G}^{\mathcal{W}} @&amp;gt;\pi^\varphi&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \mathcal{G}^{\mathcal{U}} \\
@VV\pi^{\varphi&apos;}V  @VV\phi V \\
\mathcal{G}^{\mathcal{V}} @&amp;gt;\psi&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \mathcal{H}.
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;Given maps \(f\colon \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{H}\) and \(g\colon \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{K}\)
represented by functors \(f^{\mathcal{U}}\) and \(g^{\mathcal{V}}\),
write \(\mathcal{V} = \{V_j\}_{j\in J}\) and let \(\mathcal{W} = \{W_i\}_{i\in I}\) be a refinement
of \(\mathcal{U}\) with the property that there is a function \(\theta\colon I \to J\)
such that \(f^{\mathcal{U}}\pi^{\mathcal{U},\mathcal{W}}(W_i) \subset V_{\theta(i)}\)
for all \(i \in I\), where 
\(\pi^{\mathcal{U},\mathcal{W}}\colon \mathcal{G}^{\mathcal{W}} \to \mathcal{G}^{\mathcal{U}}\) 
is some choice of refinement functor.
There is a functor \(f^{\mathcal{V},\mathcal{W}}\colon \mathcal{G}^{\mathcal{W}}\to\mathcal{H}^{\mathcal{V}}\)
defined on objects as&lt;/p&gt;

\[f^{\mathcal{V},\mathcal{W}}(x_i) = (f^{\mathcal{U}}\pi^{\mathcal{U},\mathcal{W}}(x_i))_{\theta(i)}\]

&lt;p&gt;and on arrows as&lt;/p&gt;

\[f^{\mathcal{V},\mathcal{W}}(f_{j,i}) =
(f^{\mathcal{U}}\pi^{\mathcal{U},\mathcal{W}}(f_{j,i}))_{\theta(j),\theta(i)}.\]

&lt;p&gt;We define the composite map \(gf\colon \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{K}\) to be the map represented by the functor
\(g^{\mathcal{V}}f^{\mathcal{V},\mathcal{W}} \colon \mathcal{G}^{\mathcal{W}} \to \mathcal{K}\).
It is perhaps not immediately obvious that this composition is well-defined and associative,
but we assure the reader that it is and that the reader probably does not want to read a demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can check more or less by hand that every span in the sense above
defines a generalized map in our sense and conversely
so that the category of étale groupoids where the arrows are our generalized maps
coincides with Moerdijk’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bibundles&quot;&gt;Bibundles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, the less-familiar approach is to use &lt;em&gt;bibundles.&lt;/em&gt;
In this section I follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://ems.press/content/serial-article-files/6839&quot;&gt;Lerman’s article&lt;/a&gt;.
We begin as follows.
A &lt;em&gt;right action&lt;/em&gt; of an étale groupoid \(\mathcal{G}\) on a space \(x\)
is the following data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a map \(a \colon X \to \mathcal{G}_0\) called the &lt;em&gt;anchor&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a map&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

\[X \times_{\mathcal{G}_0} \mathcal{G}_1 = \{(x,f) \in X \times \mathcal{G}_1 : a(x) = \omega(f)\} 
\to X, \qquad (x,f) \mapsto x.f\]

&lt;p&gt;called the &lt;em&gt;action&lt;/em&gt; such that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;\(a(x.f) = \alpha(f)\) for all \(x\) and \(f\) for which \(x.f\) is defined&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;\((x.f).g = x.(fg)\) when appropriate and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;\(x.1_{a(x)} = x\) for all \(x \in X\).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is similarly a definition of a &lt;em&gt;left&lt;/em&gt; action of a groupoid on a space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If \(X\) is equipped with a right action of an étale groupoid \(\mathcal{G}\),
we say that \(X\) is a &lt;em&gt;principal (right) \(\mathcal{G}\)-bundle over B&lt;/em&gt;
if there is an open surjection \(\pi\colon X \to B\) such that the following hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For each \(b \in B\), there exists a neighborhood \(U\) of \(b\) and a &lt;em&gt;section&lt;/em&gt;
\(s\colon U \to X\) such that \(\pi s = 1_U\). 
(In the case of orbifolds where we’re working with smooth manifolds,
the existence of local sections is guaranteed by the property that \(\pi\)
is a &lt;em&gt;submersion.&lt;/em&gt;
In general there are open surjections which do not admit local sections,
so I think we have to build this into the theory.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have \(\pi(x.f) = \pi(x)\) for all \((x,f) \in X\times_{\mathcal{G}_0} \mathcal{G}_1\)—we
describe this by saying that \(\pi\) is &lt;em&gt;\(\mathcal{G}\)-invariant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The map \((x,f) \mapsto (x,x.f)\) is a homeomorphism
\(X\times_{\mathcal{G}_0}\mathcal{G}_1 \to X \times_B X\);
in other words \(\mathcal{G}\) acts freely and transitively on the fibers of \(\pi\colon X \to B\).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given an étale groupoid \(\mathcal{G}\), the target map \(\omega\colon \mathcal{G}_1 \to \mathcal{G}_0\)
makes \(\mathcal{G}_1\) into a right principal \(\mathcal{G}\)-bundle,
where the action of \(\mathcal{G}\) is right-multiplication 
and the anchor is \(\alpha\colon \mathcal{G}_1 \to \mathcal{G}_0\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;bibundle&lt;/em&gt; from \(\mathcal{G}\) to \(\mathcal{H}\)
is a space \(X\) together with \(a_L \colon X \to \mathcal{G}_0\) and \(a_R \colon X \to \mathcal{H}_0\)
such that the following properties hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is a left action of \(\mathcal{G}\) on \(X\) with respect to the anchor \(a_L\)
and a right action of \(\mathcal{H}\) on \(X\) with respect to the anchor \(a_R\).
These actions commute.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The map \(a_L \colon X \to \mathcal{G}_0\) makes \(X\) a principal \(\mathcal{H}\)-bundle.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The map \(a_R\) is \(\mathcal{G}\)-invariant in the sense that \(a_R(g.x) = a_R(x)\) for all \((g,x)\)
for which \(g.x\) is defined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two bibundles \(X,Y \colon \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{H}\) are &lt;em&gt;isomorphic&lt;/em&gt;
if there is a \(\mathcal{G}\)–\(\mathcal{H}\)-equivariant homeomorphism \(\eta\colon X \to Y\),
i.e. \(\eta(g.x.f) = g.\eta(x).f\) for all triples for which the actions are defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bibundles-defined-by-functors&quot;&gt;Bibundles defined by functors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given a functor \(\phi \colon \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{H}\), there is a bibundle \(X_\phi\)
where&lt;/p&gt;

\[X_\phi = \{ (x,f) \in \mathcal{G}_0 \times \mathcal{H}_1 : \phi_0(x) = \omega(f)\}\]

&lt;p&gt;and \(B\) is \(\mathcal{G}_0\). The right action of \(\mathcal{H}\) is the restriction of the obvious action
on the product \(\mathcal{G}_0 \times \mathcal{H}_1\).
In other words, \((x,f).h = (x,fh)\).
The left action of \(\mathcal{G}\) over the anchor \((x,f) \mapsto x\)
is defined by \(g.(x,f) = (\omega(g),\phi_1(g)h)\).
It is clear that the actions commute,
and that the map \(a_R\) defined by \((x,f) \mapsto \alpha(f)\) is \(\mathcal{G}\)-invariant,
since \(a_R(g.(x,f)) = \alpha(\phi_1(g)f) = \alpha(f)\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us check that \((x,f) \mapsto x\) makes \(X_\phi\) into a principal \(\mathcal{H}\)-bundle.
The projection \((x,f) \mapsto x\) is certainly an open surjection which is \(\mathcal{H}\)-invariant.
Consider the map \(((x,f),g) \mapsto ((x,f),(x,fg))\)
from \(X_\phi \times_{\mathcal{H}_0}\mathcal{H}_1 \to X_\phi \times_{\mathcal{G}_0} X_\phi\).
We claim that this is a homeomorphism,
indeed that the map \(((x,f),(x,g)) \mapsto ((x,f),f^{-1}g)\) is a continuous inverse.
To see that this is well-defined notice that
the multiplication \(f^{-1}g\) is defined, since \(\phi_0(x) = \omega(f) = \omega(g)\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bibundles may be composed (I’ll neglect to mention &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;),
but the composition is only associative up to isomorphism of bibundles.
If one thinks of isomorphisms between bibundles as being akin to natural transformations
(indeed, naturally isomorphic functors have isomorphic associated bibundles),
then the category of étale groupoids with arrows bibundles is what’s called a &lt;em&gt;weak&lt;/em&gt; \(2\)-category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-equivalence-of-the-two-approaches&quot;&gt;The equivalence of the two approaches&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is already quite long, but I wanted to explain how to see that bibundles
give rise to generalized maps in our sense.
So let \(X \colon \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{H}\) be a bibundle.
For each \(p \in \mathcal{G}_0\), there is a local section \(s_p\colon U_p \to X\)
defined on a neighborhood of \(p\).
Consider the open cover \(\mathcal{U} = \{U_p\}_{p \in \mathcal{G}_0}\) of \(\mathcal{G}_0\),
and the space&lt;/p&gt;

\[X^{\mathcal{U}} = \mathcal{G}^{\mathcal{U}}_0 \times_{\mathcal{G}_0} X
= \{ (p_i,x) \in \mathcal{G}^{\mathcal{U}}_0 \times X : p = a_L(x) \}\]

&lt;p&gt;We claim that map \((p_i,x) \mapsto p_i\) makes \(X^{\mathcal{U}}\) into a principal \(\mathcal{H}\)-bundle,
where the anchor is \((p_i,x) \mapsto a_R(x)\) and the action is \((p_i,x).h = (p_i,x.h)\). 
Notice that \(p = a_L(x.h) = a_L(x)\) since \(X\) is \(\mathcal{H}\)-principal, so this is well-defined,
and clearly \(\mathcal{H}\)-invariant.
Now consider the map \(((p_i,x),h) \mapsto ((p_i,x),(p_i,x.h))\).
Since \((x,h) \mapsto (x,x.h)\) is a homeomorphism, this map will also be a homeomorphism,
proving the claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a left action of \(\mathcal{G}^{\mathcal{U}}\) on \(X^{\mathcal{U}}\)
where the anchor is \((p_i,x) \mapsto p_i\) and the action is \(g_{j,i}.(p_i,x) = (\omega(g_{j,i}),g.x)\). 
By the definition of the left action of \(\mathcal{G}\) on \(X\), this is well-defined.
It is clear that the left and right actions commute; we have already shown that \(X^{\mathcal{U}}\)
is \(\mathcal{H}\)-principal,
and we have \((\omega(g_{j,i}),g.x) \mapsto a_R(g.x) = a_R (x)\), so the right anchor is left invariant.
Therefore we have a bibundle \(X^{\mathcal{U}} \colon \mathcal{G}^{\mathcal{U}} \to \mathcal{H}\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bibundle \(X^{\mathcal{U}}\) has a global section \(p_i \mapsto (p_i,s_i(p))\).
If \((p_i,x)\) is another point of \(X^{\mathcal{U}}\),
since \(X^{\mathcal{U}} \times_{\mathcal{H}_0} \mathcal{H}_1\) is homeomorphic to
\(X^{\mathcal{U}}\times_{\mathcal{G}^{\mathcal{U}}_0} X^{\mathcal{U}}\),
there exists a unique arrow \(h \in \mathcal{H}_1\) such that \((p_i,x) = (p_i,s_i(p)).h\).
We claim the map \((p_i,x) \mapsto (p_i,h)\)
from \(X^{\mathcal{U}}\) to&lt;/p&gt;

\[\{ (p_i,h) \in \mathcal{G}^{\mathcal{U}}_0\times \mathcal{H}_1 : a_R(s_i(p)) = \omega(h) \}\]

&lt;p&gt;is a homeomorphism. Indeed, the map \((p_i,h) \mapsto (p_i,s_i(p).h)\) is its inverse.
We claim that the rule \(\phi_0(p_i) = a_R(s_i(p))\) defines the action on objects of a functor
\(\mathcal{G}^{\mathcal{U}} \to \mathcal{H}\).
The action on arrows sends \(g_{j,i} \colon x_i \to y_j\) to the unique arrow \(\phi_1(g_{j,i})\) such that
\(g_{j,i} . (x_i, s_i(x)) = (y_j, s_j(y)).\phi_1(g_{j,i})\).
Given \(f_{k,j} \colon y_j \to z_k\), notice that&lt;/p&gt;

\[f_{k,j} . g_{j,i} . (x_i, s_i(x)) = f_{k,j} . (y_j, s_j(y)). \phi_1(g_{j,i}) 
= (z_k, s_k(z)) . \phi_1(f_{k,j}) . \phi_1(g_{j,i})\]

&lt;p&gt;since the left and right actions commute.
On the other hand,&lt;/p&gt;

\[(f_{k,j}g_{j,i}) . (x_i, s_i(x)) = (z_k,s_k(z)) .\phi_1(f_{k,j}g_{j,i})\]

&lt;p&gt;so since the left action is associative, \(\phi_1\) indeed defines a functor!

by arguing that there is a problem with gluing maps.
The purpose of this blog post is to try to digest this critique.
We follow the notation set up in the previous two blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lerman’s critique takes place in the realm of bibundles,
but as we saw in the &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/05/15/Maps-of-%C3%A9tale-groupoids.html&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;,
it’s possible to translate from the bibundles point of view to the generalized maps point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lerman’s bibundles \(X\) and \(Y\) are from \(S^1\), 
thought of as a groupoid with only identity arrows,
to \(C_2\), thought of as a groupoid with one object.
If you chase through the definitions,
you see that a bibundle is thus a principal \(C_2\) bundle over \(S^1\).
There are two: the trivial bundle \(S^1\times C_2\)
and the nontrivial bundle which is \(S^1\) double covering itself.
Call the former \(X\) and the latter \(Y\).
The former bundle has a global section and so ought to be represented by an honest functor \(S^1 \to C_2\).
There is only one such functor, sending every object of \(S^1\) to the unique object of \(C_2\)
and sending all the arrows to the identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the nontrivial bundle \(Y\),
we can choose contractible open neighborhoods \(U_1\) and \(U_2\) which cover \(S^1\)
and on which there exist local sections \(s_1\) and \(s_2\).
The groupoid \((S^1)^{\mathcal{U}}\) has space of objects the disjoint copy of two open intervals in \(\mathbb{R}\)
and space of arrows of the form
\((1_x)_{j,i} \colon x_i \to x_j\) for \(x \in U_i \cap U_j\).
Topologically this space of arrows is a copy of the object space (for the identity arrows)
together with two copies of the intersection \(U_1 \cap U_2\) (which is disconnected),
one for arrows of the form \((1_x)_{1,2}\) and another for the arrows \((1_x)_{2,1}\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aha! Think about the definition of these local sections:
on one component of the intersection \(U_1\cap U_2\), the sections agree,
while on the other, they differ by the action of \(C_2\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/circlebundle.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;The nontrivial bundle with its local sections&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, if we chase through the construction given in the &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/05/15/Maps-of-%C3%A9tale-groupoids.html&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;,
we see that the resulting functor \((S^2)^{\mathcal{U}} \to C_2\)
sends all identity arrows to the identity arrow of \(C_2\) (as they must be sent),
and for \(x\) in the first component of \(U_1 \cap U_2\),
the arrows \((1_x)_{1,2}\) and \((1_x)_{2,1}\) are sent to the identity,
while for all \(x\) in the second component of \(U_1 \cap U_2\),
the arrows \((1_x)_{1,2}\) and \((1_x)_{2,1}\) are sent to the nontrivial arrow in \(C_2\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s clear in bibundle land that these are the two isomorphism classes of maps from \(S^1\) to \(C_2\),
and I think I buy in generalized map land that any generalized map will be one of these two as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complaint, if I understand it, is this:
we can also define the functor associated to the trivial bundle on the open cover \(\mathcal{U}\).
If you restrict either of these functors to either \(U_1\) or \(U_2\),
you get the same map: since \(U_1\) and \(U_2\) are contractible, the only principal \(C_2\)-bundles
over \(U_1\) and \(U_2\) are trivial.
This is slightly less clear in generalized maps land:
you could imagine cutting up an open interval into a couple pieces and having some of the
identifying arrows on the overlaps map to the nontrivial arrow in \(C_2\).
The point, though, is that you can undo this difference with a natural transformation,
essentially because the subintervals you slice into only overlap their neighbors once,
not twice as in the example above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is a serious issue:
imagine having only the functors from \(U_1\) and \(U_2\) to \(C_2\).
There’s only one choice of functor and only one generalized map.
Nevertheless, when you try to glue these maps together to give you a new map from \(S^1\) to \(C_2\),
you find that there are &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; possible maps!
What’s worse, since \(U_1\) and \(U_2\) don’t see the arrows on the overlaps,
there’s &lt;em&gt;no way&lt;/em&gt; to tell from the restriction which of the two maps you’re trying to end up with!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Lerman critiques the category of étale groupoids with arrows generalized maps by arguing that there is a problem with gluing maps.

Time to rectify this situation.
The purpose of this post is to explain how to see graphs of groups as étale groupoids.
In a later post I’d like to explore the notion of maps between étale groupoids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;groupoids&quot;&gt;Groupoids&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;groupoid&lt;/em&gt; is a small category \(\mathcal{G}\) in which all arrows are invertible.
Thus there are two sets, \(\mathcal{G}_0\) and \(\mathcal{G}_1\) of objects and arrows respectively,
and several structure maps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;\(\alpha\), \(\omega\colon \mathcal{G}_1 \to \mathcal{G}_0\) sending an arrow \(f\colon x \to y\)
to its &lt;em&gt;source&lt;/em&gt; \(x\) and &lt;em&gt;target&lt;/em&gt; \(y\) respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An injection \(\iota\colon \mathcal{G}_0 \to \mathcal{G}_1\) sending an object \(x\) to the identity arrow
\(1_x\colon x \to x\).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An inversion map \((\cdot)^{-1}\colon \mathcal{G}_1 \to \mathcal{G}_1\)
sending an arrow \(f\colon x \to y\) to its inverse \(f^{-1}\colon y \to x\).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A multiplication map \(\circ\colon \mathcal{G}_1 \times_{\mathcal{G}_0} \mathcal{G}_1 \to \mathcal{G}_1\)
sending a pair of arrows \(f\) and \(g\) with \(\alpha(f) = \omega(g)\) to their composite
\(g\circ f = gf\).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The maps are required to satisfy certain identities saying,
for instance, that composition is associative.
A &lt;em&gt;topological groupoid&lt;/em&gt; is a groupoid equipped with a topology on \(\mathcal{G}_0\) and \(\mathcal{G}_1\)
making all the structure maps continuous.
A topological groupoid is &lt;em&gt;étale&lt;/em&gt; if \(\alpha\) and \(\omega\) are étale maps, i.e. local homeomorphisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given an étale groupoid and a point \(x \in \mathcal{G}_0\),
its &lt;em&gt;orbit&lt;/em&gt; is the set&lt;/p&gt;

\[\mathcal{G}\cdot x = \{ y \in \mathcal{G}_0 : \exists f\colon x \to y\}.\]

&lt;p&gt;The orbits partition \(\mathcal{G}_0\) and the &lt;em&gt;space of orbits&lt;/em&gt; \(\mathcal{G}_1\backslash\mathcal{G}_0\)
is the quotient space given the quotient topology.
We may also define the &lt;em&gt;isotropy group&lt;/em&gt; \(\mathcal{G}_x\) as&lt;/p&gt;

\[\mathcal{G}_x = \{ f \in \mathcal{G}_1 : \alpha(f) = \omega(f) = x \}.\]

&lt;p&gt;Since \(\mathcal{G}\) is étale, it turns out that \(\mathcal{G}_x\) is discrete as a subspace of \(\mathcal{G}_1\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;graphs-of-groups-as-étale-groupoids&quot;&gt;Graphs of groups as étale groupoids&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I’ve mentioned how orbifolds may be thought of as étale groupoids.
Indeed, Haefliger describes this in Chapter III.\(\mathcal{G}\) of 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/bridsonhaefligerx.pdf&quot;&gt;Metric Spaces of Nonpositive Curvature&lt;/a&gt;.
(Incidentally, I like to cheekily use the citation command “TheBible” for that book,
even though my research has called for citing it less frequently than I originally expected.)
What is maybe less well-known (although Haefliger also covers this)
is how to view a graph of groups (or more generally a &lt;em&gt;complex&lt;/em&gt; of groups) as an étale groupoid.
I’ll describe how to do this for &lt;em&gt;effective&lt;/em&gt; graphs of groups,
where the construction is a little slicker,
although one could give a “hands-on” construction in the general case without too much difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us set notation. A &lt;em&gt;graph of groups&lt;/em&gt; \((\Gamma,\mathscr{G})\) is a connected graph \(\Gamma\)
together with an assignment of groups \(\mathscr{G}_v\) and \(\mathscr{G}_e\) to each vertex \(v\) and edge \(e\)
of \(\Gamma\).
When the oriented edge \(e\) has initial vertex \(v\),
we require the existence of an injective homomorphism \(\mathscr{G}_e \to \mathscr{G}_v\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given a vertex \(v\), write \(\operatorname{st}(v)\) for the set of oriented edges \(e\) with initial vertex \(v\).
Let \(\tau(e)\) denote the terminal vertex of the oriented edge \(e\).
Let \(\widetilde{\operatorname{st}}(v)\) be the quotient of the disjoint union&lt;/p&gt;

\[\coprod_{e\in\operatorname{st}(v)} \mathscr{G}_v/\iota_e(\mathscr{G}_e) \times (e \setminus \tau(e))\]

&lt;p&gt;by the equivalence relation that identifies the initial vertex of all of these oriented edges.
(To make the resulting groupoid étale, we need to remove the terminal vertices.)
Call the identified vertex \(v\).
There is a natural action of \(\mathscr{G}_v\) on \(\widetilde{\operatorname{st}}(v)\) by multiplication in the labels.
This action fixes \(v\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A graph of groups is &lt;em&gt;effective&lt;/em&gt; if only the family of trivial subgroups of each \(\mathscr{G}_v\)
satisfies the following conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For each vertex $v$, we have a normal subgroup \(N_v\le \mathscr{G}_v\).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For each edge \(e\) of \(\Gamma\) with initial vertex \(v\) and terminal vertex \(w\),
there is a subgroup \(N_e\) of \(\mathscr{G}_e\) such that \(\iota_e(N_e) = N_v\) and \(\iota_{\bar e}(N_e) = N_w\).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let \(\mathcal{G}_0\) be the disjoint union of the spaces \(\widetilde{\operatorname{st}}(v)\)
as \(v\) varies over the vertices of \(\Gamma\).
Each element of each \(\mathscr{G}_v\) acts as a homeomorphism of an open neighborhood of \(\mathcal{G}_0\).
The orientation reversal of the interior of an oriented edge \(e\mapsto \bar e\)
also defines a homeomorphism of an open neighborhood of \(\mathcal{G}_0\) for each pair of lifts
of the interiors of \(e\) and \(\bar e\) to \(\mathcal{G}_0\).
We may consider the &lt;em&gt;pseudogroup&lt;/em&gt; generated by these local homeomorphisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Briefly, the &lt;em&gt;pseudogroup generated&lt;/em&gt; by a collection of homeomorphisms \(f\colon U \to V\) 
of open subsets of a topological space \(X\)
(such that the unions of the \(U\) cover \(X\))
is the smallest collection of homeomorphisms containing the given collection 
and satisfying the following properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The restriction of a homeomorphism \(f\colon U \to V\) in the collection
to an open subset of \(U\) is in the collection.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The composition \(gf\) of any two elements \(f\colon U \to V\) and \(g \colon V \to W\)
in the collection
is in the collection (note the domain of \(g\)).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The inverse of any homeomorphism in the collection is in the collection.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If \(f\colon U \to V\) is a homeomorphism with the property that
there is an open cover \(\{U_i\}\) of \(U\) such that \(f|_{U_i}\) is in the collection for each \(i\),
then \(f\) is in the collection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The space of arrows \(\mathcal{G}_1\) is the space of &lt;em&gt;germs&lt;/em&gt; of elements of the pseudogroup.
A &lt;em&gt;germ&lt;/em&gt; of a homeomorphism \(f\colon U \to V\) at a point \(x \in U\)
is its equivalence class under the equivalence relation of agreement under restriction to a neighborhood of \(x\).
The germ therefore has a well-defined &lt;em&gt;source&lt;/em&gt; \(\alpha(f) = x\)
and &lt;em&gt;target&lt;/em&gt; \(\omega(f) = f(x)\).
We give \(\mathcal{G}_1\) the &lt;em&gt;germ topology:&lt;/em&gt; a basis for this topology is given by sets of the form \(U_f\),
where \(f\colon U \to V\) is a homeomorphism and \(U_f\) 
consists of the germs of \(f\) at the various points of \(U\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To bring things down to earth, if you chase through the definitions,
you see that if \(v\) is a vertex of \(\Gamma\) thought of as a point of \(\mathcal{G}_0\),
then \(\mathcal{G}_v = \mathscr{G}_v\).
The point \(v\) is equal to its orbit \(\mathcal{G}\cdot v\).
If \(x\) is a point in the interior of an edge \(e\),
then \(x\) determines an orbit in \(\mathcal{G}_0\) comprising all those points 
in each \(\widetilde{\operatorname{st}}(v)\)
of the form \((g\iota_e(\mathscr{G}_e), x) \subset \mathscr{G}_v/\iota_e(\mathscr{G}_e)\times e \setminus \tau(e)\)
where \(e\) is allowed to occur in either orientation.
Put another way, we have \(\Gamma = \mathcal{G}_1\backslash\mathcal{G}_0\).
The isotropy group \(\mathcal{G}_x\) is isomorphic to \(\mathscr{G}_e\).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">It’s been a while since I talked about étale groupoids!

I wrote a short paper generalizing a classical lemma of Whitehead.
The purpose of this post is to describe Whitehead’s lemma and my generalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/04/02/The-star-graph.html&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, we met the star graph
associated to a collection of conjugacy classes of elements
of a virtually free group.
It should be reasonably clear that one can extend
the notion of a star graph to conjugacy classes of elements
of a group that acts cocompactly on a tree.
What is perhaps less obvious is that one can also extend this notion
to convex-cocompact subgroups of groups acting on trees,
where a subgroup is &lt;em&gt;convex-cocompact&lt;/em&gt; if it acts cocompactly on its minimal subtree.
This generalization is due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10052&quot;&gt;Bestvina, Feighn and Handel&lt;/a&gt; in the case of free groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is the following.
A classical observation of Stallings says that 
any finitely generated subgroup \(H\) of a free group \(G\)
may be represented by an immersion of a finite graph \(\Gamma\) into a rose \(R\),
that is a graph with one vertex \(w\) and \(n\) edges, where \(n\) is the rank of \(G\).
The set of directions \(D_w\) is the set of oriented edges of \(R\).
Cut each edge of \(\Gamma\) at its midpoint,
observe that the half-edge left over crosses a direction of \(R\)
and attach, in the star graph of \(\Gamma\),
the half-edge to the vertex corresponding to the given direction in \(D_w\).
Thus we get a bipartite graph with one vertex for each vertex of \(\Gamma\)
and one vertex for each direction in \(D_w\).
A pair of directions are connected by a path of length two in this star graph
if and only if the corresponding &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/04/02/The-star-graph.html&quot;&gt;turn&lt;/a&gt; 
is in the image of the map on turns associated to the immersion \(\Gamma \to R\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea generalizes readily to \(G\) the fundamental group of a graph of groups \(\mathbb{G}\).
A subgroup of \(G\) is convex-cocompact if and only if it may be represented as an immersion
of a finite connected graph of groups \(f\colon \mathcal{G} \to \mathbb{G}\).
The set of directions we have met before.
Rather than snipping edges at midpoints in \(\mathcal{G}\),
we essentially do this in the Bass–Serre tree.
If \(v\) is a vertex of \(\mathcal{G}\) mapping to a vertex \(w\) in \(\mathbb{G}\),
we attach \(|\mathbb{G}_w : f_v(\mathcal{G}_v)|\) copies of this &lt;em&gt;piece&lt;/em&gt;
of the Bass–Serre tree,
where the \(gf_v(\mathcal{G}_v)\) copy attaches an edge corresponding to a direction \(d\) in \(D_v\)
to the vertex corresponding to the direction \(g.D_vf(d)\) in \(D_w\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose there exists \(\mathcal{G}&apos;\) a graph of groups with fundamental group \(G\) and one edge
with the property that \(\mathcal{G}&apos;\) may be obtained from a graph of groups
&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/01/06/From-free-splittings-to-graphs-of-groups.html&quot;&gt;homotopy equivalent&lt;/a&gt; to \(\mathbb{G}\) by collapsing edges.
Anyway, say that a conjugacy class of an element or convex-cocompact subgroup of \(G\) is &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt;
if there is such a graph of groups \(\mathcal{G}&apos;\) with the property that our element or subgroup
is conjugate into a vertex group in \(\mathcal{G}&apos;\).
For free groups thought of as fundamental groups of ordinary graphs,
it’s not hard to see that an element or finitely generated (hence convex-cocompact) subgroup
is simple if and only if it is contained in a proper free factor of the free group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main result of my paper is that if we have a &lt;em&gt;jointly&lt;/em&gt; simple collection \(C\) of conjugacy classes
of elements or convex-cocompact subgroups of \(G\)
(i.e. the same \(\mathcal{G}&apos;\) works for all members of \(C\) at once)
then the star graph of \(C\) is either disconnected or has a cut vertex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ahh but Rylee,” you say astutely, paying far too much attention, “Isn’t the star graph already disconnected
if \(\mathbb{G}\) has more than one vertex?”
To which I have to concede that you are correct and explain my usage further.
The star graph is a union of graphs \(\Gamma_w\) as \(w\) varies over the vertices of \(\mathbb{G}\),
where \(\Gamma_w\) contains all the vertices corresponding to directions in \(D_w\).
We say that the star graph is disconnected if some \(\Gamma_w\) is disconnected,
and that it has a cut vertex if each \(\Gamma_w\) is connected and there is some direction \(d \in D_w\),
the removal of which disconnects \(\Gamma_w\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proof is very much inspired by a paper of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/jgth-2018-0118/html?lang=en&quot;&gt;Heusener and Weidmann&lt;/a&gt;,
which gives a proof of the classical Whitehead lemma for free groups using Stallings folds.
The idea is that if a collection of conjugacy classes is simple,
there is a graph which folds onto the rose with a single fold
(their term is “almost rose”)
in which these conjugacy classes may be read,
in the sense that the immersion \(f\colon \Gamma \to R\) factors through the almost rose.
They prove that (their version of) the star graph of an almost rose has a cut vertex
and that if the map \(f\colon \Gamma \to R\) factors through a graph \(\Theta\),
then the star graph of \(\Gamma\) is a subgraph of the star graph of \(\Theta\).
Although we are working with a different notion of the star graph,
the broad-strokes outline of the proof carries over to our graph of groups setting!

To prove that (the reduced spine of) Outer Space for a virtually free group
is contractible, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226534036_Equivariant_outer_space_and_automorphisms_of_free-by-finite_groups/link/5762c70508aee61395bef5dc/download&quot;&gt;Krstić and Vogtmann&lt;/a&gt;
define what is essentially a combinatorial analogue of a non-singular Morse function
on Outer Space and show that for a well-chosen function,
the set of minimal vertices of the complex is actually the star of a single reduced marked graph of groups,
which is contractible.
A key tool to that end is the &lt;em&gt;star graph,&lt;/em&gt;
and the purpose of this post is to describe the star graph (for conjugacy classes)
in a virtually free group and describe its usefulness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-reduced-spine-of-outer-space&quot;&gt;The reduced spine of Outer Space&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we describe the star graph, let’s define the complex we’re working with.
Given a virtually (non-abelian, to keep things interesting) free group \(F\),
we’ll call the reduced spine of Outer Space \(L(F)\).
In tree language, a vertex of \(L(F)\)
is an action of \(F\) on a simplicial tree \(T\) with finite stabilizers and finite quotient
with the property that every edge of \(T\) is &lt;em&gt;surviving,&lt;/em&gt; see &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/03/26/Shelters-in-graphs-of-groups.html&quot;&gt;the post on shelters&lt;/a&gt;
for a definition.
Two tree actions \(T\) and \(T&apos;\) are &lt;em&gt;equivalent&lt;/em&gt; if there is an equivariant homeomorphism between them.
The set of equivalence classes is partially ordered under &lt;em&gt;forest collapse,&lt;/em&gt;
and the &lt;em&gt;reduced spine of Outer Space&lt;/em&gt; is the geometric realization of this poset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In graphs of groups language, 
a vertex of \(L(F)\) is a finite graph of finite groups \(\mathcal{G}\)
which is a union of &lt;em&gt;shelters&lt;/em&gt;
together with a &lt;em&gt;marking,&lt;/em&gt; which we can think of as an identification of \(\pi_1(\mathcal{G})\) with \(F\),
well-defined up to inner automorphism,
or as a &lt;em&gt;homotopy equivalence&lt;/em&gt; in the sense of &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02848&quot;&gt;my paper&lt;/a&gt;
\(\sigma\colon \mathbb{G} \to \mathcal{G}\)
from a fixed graph of finite groups \(\mathbb{G}\).
Two marked graphs of groups \(\tau = (\mathcal{G},\sigma)\) and \(\tau&apos; = (\mathcal{G}&apos;,\sigma&apos;)\)
are &lt;em&gt;equivalent&lt;/em&gt; if there is an isomorphism of graphs of groups
\(h \colon \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{G}&apos;\) such that \(h\sigma\) is homotopic to \(\sigma&apos;\).
There is also a notion of &lt;em&gt;forest collapse&lt;/em&gt; in graphs of groups,
which partially orders the set of equivalence classes of marked graphs of groups.
A marked graph of groups \(\tau = (\mathcal{G},\sigma)\) is &lt;em&gt;reduced&lt;/em&gt; if it is minimal in this partial order.
The complex \(L(F)\) is the geometric realization of this poset.
We will adopt the graphs of groups language in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-norm&quot;&gt;The norm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let \(\tau = (\mathcal{G},\sigma)\) be a marked graph of groups in \(L(F)\),
and let \(W\) be a finite set of infinite order elements of \(F\).
These elements are hyperbolic in some and hence every tree action in \(L(F)\),
so we may measure \(\ell(w)\), their hyperbolic translation length,
and we define a &lt;em&gt;norm&lt;/em&gt; on \(\tau\) as&lt;/p&gt;

\[\|\tau\| = \sum_{w \in W} \ell(w).\]

&lt;p&gt;We can represent each conjugacy class \(\sigma_\sharp(w)\) in \(\pi_1(\mathcal{G})\)
as a cyclically reduced graph-of-groups &lt;em&gt;edge path&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

\[\gamma_w = g_0e_1g_1\ldots e_kg_k.\]

&lt;p&gt;We have \(\ell(w) = k\), the number of edges in \(\gamma_w\).
Recall that for each vertex \(v\) of \(\mathcal{G}\) we have the set of &lt;em&gt;directions at \(v\)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

\[D_v = \coprod_{e\in\operatorname{st}(v)} \mathcal{G}_v/\iota_e(\mathcal{G}_e) \times \{e\}.\]

&lt;p&gt;There is an obvious left action of \(\mathcal{G}_v\) on \(D_v\)
which descends to an action on the set of pairs of directions at \(v\).
A &lt;em&gt;turn&lt;/em&gt; is an orbit under this action.
A turn is &lt;em&gt;degenerate&lt;/em&gt; if every pair of directions representing it are identical
and is &lt;em&gt;nondegenerate&lt;/em&gt; otherwise.
The vertex group elements of the path \(\gamma_w\) are not quite well-defined
if the edge groups of \(\mathcal{G}\) are nontrivial,
but the &lt;em&gt;turns&lt;/em&gt; \([\{(\iota_{\bar e_i}(\mathcal{G}_{\bar e_i}),\bar e_i),
(g_i\iota_{e_{i+1}}(\mathcal{G}_{e_{i+1}}),e_{i+1})\}]\)
for \(1 \le i \le k-1\) and \([\{(g_k^{-1}\iota_{\bar e_k}(\mathcal{G}_{e_k}),e_k),
(g_0\iota_{e_1}(\mathcal{G}_{e_1}),e_1)\}]\)
are well-defined.
We say that \(\gamma_w\) &lt;em&gt;crosses&lt;/em&gt; these turns, which are nondegenerate
because \(\gamma_w\) is cyclically reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-star-graph&quot;&gt;The star graph&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We define the &lt;em&gt;star graph&lt;/em&gt; of a marked graph of groups \(\tau = (\mathcal{G},\sigma)\)
with respect to \(W\).
Its vertex set is the union of the sets \(D_v\) as \(v\) varies over the vertices of \(\mathcal{G}\).
For each turn crossed by some \(\gamma_w\),
the star graph contains \(|\mathcal{G}_v|\) edges,
each one connecting a pair of directions representing this turn.
Since the turns crossed by \(\gamma_w\) are nondegenerate, the star graph contains no loop edges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/stargraph.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;A star graph&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above example we have&lt;/p&gt;

\[F = C_4*_{C_2} C_4 * C_3 = \langle s, t, u \mid s^4 = t^4 = u^3 = 1,\ s^2 = t^2 \rangle,\]

&lt;p&gt;and the marked graph of groups \(\tau = (\mathcal{G},\sigma)\) is the “obvious”
graph of groups presentation of \(F\).
There are three vertices with vertex groups \(\langle s\rangle\),
\(\langle t\rangle\) and \(\langle u\rangle\).
There are two edges \(a\) and \(b\).
The vertex \(v\) with vertex group \(\langle t\rangle\) has valence two;
both \(a\) and \(b\) are incident to it in the positive orientation.
The edge \(a\) connects \(v\) to the vertex with vertex group \(\langle s\rangle\)
and has \(C_2\) edge group, while \(b\) has trivial edge group.
The set \(W\) is the singleton \(\{stu^2t^2\}\).
The star graph of of \(\tau\) with respect to \(W\)
has eleven vertices.
The component corresponding to \(\langle s\rangle\) has two vertices,
and there are four edges corresponding to the turns in the orbit 
\([\{(\langle s^2\rangle,\bar a),(s\langle s^2\rangle,\bar a)\}]\).
The component corresponding to \(\langle u\rangle\) has three vertices,
and there are three edges corresponding to the turns in the orbit
\([\{(1,\bar b),(u^2,\bar b)\}]\).
The component corresponding to the vertex \(v\) has six vertices,
two for directions with underlying oriented edge \(a\) and two with underlying oriented edge \(b\).
This subgraph of the star graph is complete bipartite
corresponding to the turns in the orbits
\([\{(\langle t^2\rangle,a),(t,b)\}]\) and \([\{(1,b),(\langle t^2\rangle,a)\}]\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can compute the norm of \(\tau\) from the star graph by summing up&lt;/p&gt;

\[\|\tau\| = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{v \in \mathcal{G}}\sum_{d \in D_v} 
\frac{\operatorname{valence}(d)}{|\mathcal{G}_v|}.\]

&lt;p&gt;So in this example we see that we have \(\|\tau\| = 4\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dot-product-and-absolute-value&quot;&gt;Dot product and absolute value&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Culler and Vogtmann,
given subsets \(S\) and \(T\) of the vertex set of a graph,
define the &lt;em&gt;dot product&lt;/em&gt; \(S\cdot T\) to be the number of (unoriented) edges in the graph
with one vertex in \(S\) and the other in \(T\).
The &lt;em&gt;absolute value&lt;/em&gt; \(|S|\) of \(S\)  is the dot product of \(S\) with its complement.
An &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/03/27/Ideal-edges.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;ideal edge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; \(\alpha\) is in particular a subset of the vertex set of the star graph,
so we may compute \(|\alpha|\).
If \(\alpha&apos; = g.\alpha\) under the action of \(\mathcal{G}_v\) on \(D_v\),
then \(|\alpha| = |\alpha&apos;|\).
Similarly a direction \(d \in D_v\) is a singleton subset of the vertex set of the star graph
and we may compute \(|d| = |\{d\}|\).
If \(d&apos; = g.d\), then \(|d| = |d&apos;|\).
Put another way, the absolute value of \(d\) is a property of the underlying oriented edge \(e\)
and we may sometimes write \(|e|\) for \(|d|\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above example, the ideal edge \(\alpha = \{(\langle t^2\rangle,a),(t,b),(t^3,b)\}\)
has absolute value \(|\alpha| = 4\),
while the direction \(d = (\langle t^2\rangle,a)\) also has absolute value \(4\).
Both \(d\) and \(\alpha\) have edge group isomorphic to \(C_2\),
so we have&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{|d|}{|\mathcal{G}_a|} = \frac{|\alpha|}{|\mathcal{G}_\alpha|} = 2.\]

&lt;p&gt;If we blow up the ideal edge \(\alpha\) obtaining \(\tau^\alpha = (\mathcal{G}^\alpha,\sigma^\alpha)\),
the original \(\gamma_w\) was \(as\bar atb u^2\bar b t^2\) and
the new \(\gamma_w\) is \(as\bar ab tu^2t^{-1}\bar b \bar\alpha t\alpha t^2\),
which has \(2\) more edges.
If we then collapse the collapsible edge \(a\) corresponding to the direction \(d \in D(\alpha)\)
to obtain \(\tau^\alpha_a\),
the new \(\gamma_w\) is \(sbtu^2t^{-1}\bar b\bar\alpha t\alpha s^2\),
which has \(2\) fewer edges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blowupanddown.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;The marked graphs of groups obtained by blowing up and then collapsing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This illustrates a general principal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proposition&lt;/strong&gt; (Krstić–Vogtmann). If \(\Phi = \{\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k\}\)
is a set of pairwise compatible ideal edges in a reduced marked graph of groups \(\tau = (\mathcal{G},\sigma)\)
and \(\{e_1,\ldots,e_k\}\) are a set of oriented edges in \(\mathcal{G}\) which form a forest in
\(\tau^{\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k}\), we have&lt;/p&gt;

\[\|\tau^{\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k}_{e_1,\ldots,e_k}\| = \|\tau\| 
+ \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{|\alpha_i|}{|\mathcal{G}_{\alpha_i}|} - \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{|e_i|}{|\mathcal{G}_{e_i}|}.\]

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wrapping-up&quot;&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;star&lt;/em&gt; of a reduced marked graph of groups \(\tau\) is the set of marked graphs of groups \(\tau&apos;\)
which collapse onto \(\tau\).
The &lt;em&gt;ball of radius \(r\)&lt;/em&gt; is the union of the stars of reduced marked graphs of groups \(\tau\)
with \(\|\tau\| \le r\).
What Krstić–Vogtmann show is that 
as long as the ball of radius \(r&apos; &amp;lt; r\) is nonempty,
the ball of radius \(r\) deformation retracts onto the ball of radius \(r&apos;\).
They show that for well-chosen \(W\), there is a single reduced marked graph of groups
of minimal norm, thus proving that \(L\) is contractible.
To do both of these steps, they make extensive use of the star graph to analyze
the effect of blowing up and collapsing edges in marked graphs of groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">In an earlier post we introduced the concept of an ideal edge in a graph of groups and described how to blow up ideal edges to construct new graphs of groups.
