I wrote a short paper generalizing a classical lemma of Whitehead.
The purpose of this post is to describe Whitehead’s lemma and my generalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/04/02/The-star-graph.html&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, we met the star graph
associated to a collection of conjugacy classes of elements
of a virtually free group.
It should be reasonably clear that one can extend
the notion of a star graph to conjugacy classes of elements
of a group that acts cocompactly on a tree.
What is perhaps less obvious is that one can also extend this notion
to convex-cocompact subgroups of groups acting on trees,
where a subgroup is &lt;em&gt;convex-cocompact&lt;/em&gt; if it acts cocompactly on its minimal subtree.
This generalization is due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10052&quot;&gt;Bestvina, Feighn and Handel&lt;/a&gt; in the case of free groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is the following.
A classical observation of Stallings says that 
any finitely generated subgroup \(H\) of a free group \(G\)
may be represented by an immersion of a finite graph \(\Gamma\) into a rose \(R\),
that is a graph with one vertex \(w\) and \(n\) edges, where \(n\) is the rank of \(G\).
The set of directions \(D_w\) is the set of oriented edges of \(R\).
Cut each edge of \(\Gamma\) at its midpoint,
observe that the half-edge left over crosses a direction of \(R\)
and attach, in the star graph of \(\Gamma\),
the half-edge to the vertex corresponding to the given direction in \(D_w\).
Thus we get a bipartite graph with one vertex for each vertex of \(\Gamma\)
and one vertex for each direction in \(D_w\).
A pair of directions are connected by a path of length two in this star graph
if and only if the corresponding &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/04/02/The-star-graph.html&quot;&gt;turn&lt;/a&gt; 
is in the image of the map on turns associated to the immersion \(\Gamma \to R\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea generalizes readily to \(G\) the fundamental group of a graph of groups \(\mathbb{G}\).
A subgroup of \(G\) is convex-cocompact if and only if it may be represented as an immersion
of a finite connected graph of groups \(f\colon \mathcal{G} \to \mathbb{G}\).
The set of directions we have met before.
Rather than snipping edges at midpoints in \(\mathcal{G}\),
we essentially do this in the Bass–Serre tree.
If \(v\) is a vertex of \(\mathcal{G}\) mapping to a vertex \(w\) in \(\mathbb{G}\),
we attach \(|\mathbb{G}_w : f_v(\mathcal{G}_v)|\) copies of this &lt;em&gt;piece&lt;/em&gt;
of the Bass–Serre tree,
where the \(gf_v(\mathcal{G}_v)\) copy attaches an edge corresponding to a direction \(d\) in \(D_v\)
to the vertex corresponding to the direction \(g.D_vf(d)\) in \(D_w\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose there exists \(\mathcal{G}&apos;\) a graph of groups with fundamental group \(G\) and one edge
with the property that \(\mathcal{G}&apos;\) may be obtained from a graph of groups
&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/01/06/From-free-splittings-to-graphs-of-groups.html&quot;&gt;homotopy equivalent&lt;/a&gt; to \(\mathbb{G}\) by collapsing edges.
Anyway, say that a conjugacy class of an element or convex-cocompact subgroup of \(G\) is &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt;
if there is such a graph of groups \(\mathcal{G}&apos;\) with the property that our element or subgroup
is conjugate into a vertex group in \(\mathcal{G}&apos;\).
For free groups thought of as fundamental groups of ordinary graphs,
it’s not hard to see that an element or finitely generated (hence convex-cocompact) subgroup
is simple if and only if it is contained in a proper free factor of the free group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main result of my paper is that if we have a &lt;em&gt;jointly&lt;/em&gt; simple collection \(C\) of conjugacy classes
of elements or convex-cocompact subgroups of \(G\)
(i.e. the same \(\mathcal{G}&apos;\) works for all members of \(C\) at once)
then the star graph of \(C\) is either disconnected or has a cut vertex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ahh but Rylee,” you say astutely, paying far too much attention, “Isn’t the star graph already disconnected
if \(\mathbb{G}\) has more than one vertex?”
To which I have to concede that you are correct and explain my usage further.
The star graph is a union of graphs \(\Gamma_w\) as \(w\) varies over the vertices of \(\mathbb{G}\),
where \(\Gamma_w\) contains all the vertices corresponding to directions in \(D_w\).
We say that the star graph is disconnected if some \(\Gamma_w\) is disconnected,
and that it has a cut vertex if each \(\Gamma_w\) is connected and there is some direction \(d \in D_w\),
the removal of which disconnects \(\Gamma_w\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proof is very much inspired by a paper of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/jgth-2018-0118/html?lang=en&quot;&gt;Heusener and Weidmann&lt;/a&gt;,
which gives a proof of the classical Whitehead lemma for free groups using Stallings folds.
The idea is that if a collection of conjugacy classes is simple,
there is a graph which folds onto the rose with a single fold
(their term is “almost rose”)
in which these conjugacy classes may be read,
in the sense that the immersion \(f\colon \Gamma \to R\) factors through the almost rose.
They prove that (their version of) the star graph of an almost rose has a cut vertex
and that if the map \(f\colon \Gamma \to R\) factors through a graph \(\Theta\),
then the star graph of \(\Gamma\) is a subgraph of the star graph of \(\Theta\).
Although we are working with a different notion of the star graph,
the broad-strokes outline of the proof carries over to our graph of groups setting!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Building on ideas from the previous post regarding the star graph, I wrote a short paper generalizing a classical lemma of Whitehead.

in a graph of groups and described how to &lt;em&gt;blow up&lt;/em&gt; ideal edges
to construct new graphs of groups.
To prove that (the reduced spine of) Outer Space for a virtually free group
is contractible, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226534036_Equivariant_outer_space_and_automorphisms_of_free-by-finite_groups/link/5762c70508aee61395bef5dc/download&quot;&gt;Krstić and Vogtmann&lt;/a&gt;
define what is essentially a combinatorial analogue of a non-singular Morse function
on Outer Space and show that for a well-chosen function,
the set of minimal vertices of the complex is actually the star of a single reduced marked graph of groups,
which is contractible.
A key tool to that end is the &lt;em&gt;star graph,&lt;/em&gt;
and the purpose of this post is to describe the star graph (for conjugacy classes)
in a virtually free group and describe its usefulness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-reduced-spine-of-outer-space&quot;&gt;The reduced spine of Outer Space&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we describe the star graph, let’s define the complex we’re working with.
Given a virtually (non-abelian, to keep things interesting) free group \(F\),
we’ll call the reduced spine of Outer Space \(L(F)\).
In tree language, a vertex of \(L(F)\)
is an action of \(F\) on a simplicial tree \(T\) with finite stabilizers and finite quotient
with the property that every edge of \(T\) is &lt;em&gt;surviving,&lt;/em&gt; see &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/03/26/Shelters-in-graphs-of-groups.html&quot;&gt;the post on shelters&lt;/a&gt;
for a definition.
Two tree actions \(T\) and \(T&apos;\) are &lt;em&gt;equivalent&lt;/em&gt; if there is an equivariant homeomorphism between them.
The set of equivalence classes is partially ordered under &lt;em&gt;forest collapse,&lt;/em&gt;
and the &lt;em&gt;reduced spine of Outer Space&lt;/em&gt; is the geometric realization of this poset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In graphs of groups language, 
a vertex of \(L(F)\) is a finite graph of finite groups \(\mathcal{G}\)
which is a union of &lt;em&gt;shelters&lt;/em&gt;
together with a &lt;em&gt;marking,&lt;/em&gt; which we can think of as an identification of \(\pi_1(\mathcal{G})\) with \(F\),
well-defined up to inner automorphism,
or as a &lt;em&gt;homotopy equivalence&lt;/em&gt; in the sense of &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02848&quot;&gt;my paper&lt;/a&gt;
\(\sigma\colon \mathbb{G} \to \mathcal{G}\)
from a fixed graph of finite groups \(\mathbb{G}\).
Two marked graphs of groups \(\tau = (\mathcal{G},\sigma)\) and \(\tau&apos; = (\mathcal{G}&apos;,\sigma&apos;)\)
are &lt;em&gt;equivalent&lt;/em&gt; if there is an isomorphism of graphs of groups
\(h \colon \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{G}&apos;\) such that \(h\sigma\) is homotopic to \(\sigma&apos;\).
There is also a notion of &lt;em&gt;forest collapse&lt;/em&gt; in graphs of groups,
which partially orders the set of equivalence classes of marked graphs of groups.
A marked graph of groups \(\tau = (\mathcal{G},\sigma)\) is &lt;em&gt;reduced&lt;/em&gt; if it is minimal in this partial order.
The complex \(L(F)\) is the geometric realization of this poset.
We will adopt the graphs of groups language in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-norm&quot;&gt;The norm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let \(\tau = (\mathcal{G},\sigma)\) be a marked graph of groups in \(L(F)\),
and let \(W\) be a finite set of infinite order elements of \(F\).
These elements are hyperbolic in some and hence every tree action in \(L(F)\),
so we may measure \(\ell(w)\), their hyperbolic translation length,
and we define a &lt;em&gt;norm&lt;/em&gt; on \(\tau\) as&lt;/p&gt;

\[\|\tau\| = \sum_{w \in W} \ell(w).\]

&lt;p&gt;We can represent each conjugacy class \(\sigma_\sharp(w)\) in \(\pi_1(\mathcal{G})\)
as a cyclically reduced graph-of-groups &lt;em&gt;edge path&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

\[\gamma_w = g_0e_1g_1\ldots e_kg_k.\]

&lt;p&gt;We have \(\ell(w) = k\), the number of edges in \(\gamma_w\).
Recall that for each vertex \(v\) of \(\mathcal{G}\) we have the set of &lt;em&gt;directions at \(v\)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

\[D_v = \coprod_{e\in\operatorname{st}(v)} \mathcal{G}_v/\iota_e(\mathcal{G}_e) \times \{e\}.\]

&lt;p&gt;There is an obvious left action of \(\mathcal{G}_v\) on \(D_v\)
which descends to an action on the set of pairs of directions at \(v\).
A &lt;em&gt;turn&lt;/em&gt; is an orbit under this action.
A turn is &lt;em&gt;degenerate&lt;/em&gt; if every pair of directions representing it are identical
and is &lt;em&gt;nondegenerate&lt;/em&gt; otherwise.
The vertex group elements of the path \(\gamma_w\) are not quite well-defined
if the edge groups of \(\mathcal{G}\) are nontrivial,
but the &lt;em&gt;turns&lt;/em&gt; \([\{(\iota_{\bar e_i}(\mathcal{G}_{\bar e_i}),\bar e_i),
(g_i\iota_{e_{i+1}}(\mathcal{G}_{e_{i+1}}),e_{i+1})\}]\)
for \(1 \le i \le k-1\) and \([\{(g_k^{-1}\iota_{\bar e_k}(\mathcal{G}_{e_k}),e_k),
(g_0\iota_{e_1}(\mathcal{G}_{e_1}),e_1)\}]\)
are well-defined.
We say that \(\gamma_w\) &lt;em&gt;crosses&lt;/em&gt; these turns, which are nondegenerate
because \(\gamma_w\) is cyclically reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-star-graph&quot;&gt;The star graph&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We define the &lt;em&gt;star graph&lt;/em&gt; of a marked graph of groups \(\tau = (\mathcal{G},\sigma)\)
with respect to \(W\).
Its vertex set is the union of the sets \(D_v\) as \(v\) varies over the vertices of \(\mathcal{G}\).
For each turn crossed by some \(\gamma_w\),
the star graph contains \(|\mathcal{G}_v|\) edges,
each one connecting a pair of directions representing this turn.
Since the turns crossed by \(\gamma_w\) are nondegenerate, the star graph contains no loop edges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/stargraph.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;A star graph&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above example we have&lt;/p&gt;

\[F = C_4*_{C_2} C_4 * C_3 = \langle s, t, u \mid s^4 = t^4 = u^3 = 1,\ s^2 = t^2 \rangle,\]

&lt;p&gt;and the marked graph of groups \(\tau = (\mathcal{G},\sigma)\) is the “obvious”
graph of groups presentation of \(F\).
There are three vertices with vertex groups \(\langle s\rangle\),
\(\langle t\rangle\) and \(\langle u\rangle\).
There are two edges \(a\) and \(b\).
The vertex \(v\) with vertex group \(\langle t\rangle\) has valence two;
both \(a\) and \(b\) are incident to it in the positive orientation.
The edge \(a\) connects \(v\) to the vertex with vertex group \(\langle s\rangle\)
and has \(C_2\) edge group, while \(b\) has trivial edge group.
The set \(W\) is the singleton \(\{stu^2t^2\}\).
The star graph of of \(\tau\) with respect to \(W\)
has eleven vertices.
The component corresponding to \(\langle s\rangle\) has two vertices,
and there are four edges corresponding to the turns in the orbit 
\([\{(\langle s^2\rangle,\bar a),(s\langle s^2\rangle,\bar a)\}]\).
The component corresponding to \(\langle u\rangle\) has three vertices,
and there are three edges corresponding to the turns in the orbit
\([\{(1,\bar b),(u^2,\bar b)\}]\).
The component corresponding to the vertex \(v\) has six vertices,
two for directions with underlying oriented edge \(a\) and two with underlying oriented edge \(b\).
This subgraph of the star graph is complete bipartite
corresponding to the turns in the orbits
\([\{(\langle t^2\rangle,a),(t,b)\}]\) and \([\{(1,b),(\langle t^2\rangle,a)\}]\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can compute the norm of \(\tau\) from the star graph by summing up&lt;/p&gt;

\[\|\tau\| = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{v \in \mathcal{G}}\sum_{d \in D_v} 
\frac{\operatorname{valence}(d)}{|\mathcal{G}_v|}.\]

&lt;p&gt;So in this example we see that we have \(\|\tau\| = 4\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dot-product-and-absolute-value&quot;&gt;Dot product and absolute value&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Culler and Vogtmann,
given subsets \(S\) and \(T\) of the vertex set of a graph,
define the &lt;em&gt;dot product&lt;/em&gt; \(S\cdot T\) to be the number of (unoriented) edges in the graph
with one vertex in \(S\) and the other in \(T\).
The &lt;em&gt;absolute value&lt;/em&gt; \(|S|\) of \(S\)  is the dot product of \(S\) with its complement.
An &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/03/27/Ideal-edges.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;ideal edge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; \(\alpha\) is in particular a subset of the vertex set of the star graph,
so we may compute \(|\alpha|\).
If \(\alpha&apos; = g.\alpha\) under the action of \(\mathcal{G}_v\) on \(D_v\),
then \(|\alpha| = |\alpha&apos;|\).
Similarly a direction \(d \in D_v\) is a singleton subset of the vertex set of the star graph
and we may compute \(|d| = |\{d\}|\).
If \(d&apos; = g.d\), then \(|d| = |d&apos;|\).
Put another way, the absolute value of \(d\) is a property of the underlying oriented edge \(e\)
and we may sometimes write \(|e|\) for \(|d|\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above example, the ideal edge \(\alpha = \{(\langle t^2\rangle,a),(t,b),(t^3,b)\}\)
has absolute value \(|\alpha| = 4\),
while the direction \(d = (\langle t^2\rangle,a)\) also has absolute value \(4\).
Both \(d\) and \(\alpha\) have edge group isomorphic to \(C_2\),
so we have&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{|d|}{|\mathcal{G}_a|} = \frac{|\alpha|}{|\mathcal{G}_\alpha|} = 2.\]

&lt;p&gt;If we blow up the ideal edge \(\alpha\) obtaining \(\tau^\alpha = (\mathcal{G}^\alpha,\sigma^\alpha)\),
the original \(\gamma_w\) was \(as\bar atb u^2\bar b t^2\) and
the new \(\gamma_w\) is \(as\bar ab tu^2t^{-1}\bar b \bar\alpha t\alpha t^2\),
which has \(2\) more edges.
If we then collapse the collapsible edge \(a\) corresponding to the direction \(d \in D(\alpha)\)
to obtain \(\tau^\alpha_a\),
the new \(\gamma_w\) is \(sbtu^2t^{-1}\bar b\bar\alpha t\alpha s^2\),
which has \(2\) fewer edges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/blowupanddown.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;The marked graphs of groups obtained by blowing up and then collapsing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This illustrates a general principal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proposition&lt;/strong&gt; (Krstić–Vogtmann). If \(\Phi = \{\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k\}\)
is a set of pairwise compatible ideal edges in a reduced marked graph of groups \(\tau = (\mathcal{G},\sigma)\)
and \(\{e_1,\ldots,e_k\}\) are a set of oriented edges in \(\mathcal{G}\) which form a forest in
\(\tau^{\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k}\), we have&lt;/p&gt;

\[\|\tau^{\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k}_{e_1,\ldots,e_k}\| = \|\tau\| 
+ \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{|\alpha_i|}{|\mathcal{G}_{\alpha_i}|} - \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{|e_i|}{|\mathcal{G}_{e_i}|}.\]

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wrapping-up&quot;&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;star&lt;/em&gt; of a reduced marked graph of groups \(\tau\) is the set of marked graphs of groups \(\tau&apos;\)
which collapse onto \(\tau\).
The &lt;em&gt;ball of radius \(r\)&lt;/em&gt; is the union of the stars of reduced marked graphs of groups \(\tau\)
with \(\|\tau\| \le r\).
What Krstić–Vogtmann show is that 
as long as the ball of radius \(r&apos; &amp;lt; r\) is nonempty,
the ball of radius \(r\) deformation retracts onto the ball of radius \(r&apos;\).
They show that for well-chosen \(W\), there is a single reduced marked graph of groups
of minimal norm, thus proving that \(L\) is contractible.
To do both of these steps, they make extensive use of the star graph to analyze
the effect of blowing up and collapsing edges in marked graphs of groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">In an earlier post we introduced the concept of an ideal edge in a graph of groups and described how to blow up ideal edges to construct new graphs of groups.

have finite outer automorphism group.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226534036_Equivariant_outer_space_and_automorphisms_of_free-by-finite_groups/link/5762c70508aee61395bef5dc/download&quot;&gt;Krstić and Vogtmann&lt;/a&gt; studied what I’ll call
the “spine of reduced Outer Space” for a virtually free group
and gave a formula for computing its dimension.
I want to point out that the dimension of this complex can be arbitrarily big
even when the virtually free group has finite outer automorphism group,
so this post will be given to understanding a particular example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pettet’s full conditions are somewhat technical.
Recall that a theorem of Karrass, Pietrowski and Solitar
characterizes the finitely generated virtually free groups
as those groups which are the fundamental group of a finite graph of finite groups.
To get a clean statement about those virtually free groups \(G\)
for which \(\operatorname{Out}(G)\) is finite,
Pettet needs to allow valence-one vertices of the corresponding graph of groups to have
finite-by-(infinite cyclic) vertex groups.
It should be possible to translate his statement into a statement
purely about graphs of finite groups,
where certain “lollipop” subgraphs are allowed special behavior
but I haven’t thought enough about how to go about doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll restrict ourselves to finite trees of finite groups \(\mathcal{G}\).
In Pettet’s language, such a graph of groups \(\mathcal{G}\) is &lt;em&gt;irreducible&lt;/em&gt;
if no edge-to-vertex group inclusion is surjective.
In the language we have been developing over the past couple posts,
I would prefer to say that \(\mathcal{G}\) is &lt;em&gt;reduced,&lt;/em&gt;
since it is not possible to collapse an edge of \(\mathcal{G}\)
without either changing the fundamental group of the graph of groups 
or introducing an infinite vertex group.
The following is a sufficient (but not necessary) condition for \(\operatorname{Out}(\pi_1(\mathcal{G}))\)
to be finite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For each oriented edge \(e \in \mathcal{G}\),
the normalizer of \(\iota_e(\mathcal{G}_e)\) in \(\pi_1(\mathcal{G})\) is finite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graph of groups I have in mind is the following:
the underlying graph is a tree with \(n-1\) leaves and only one non-leaf vertex.
The vertex groups are all the symmetric group on 3 letters, \(S_3\),
and the edge groups are all cyclic of order 2.
The fundamental group of this graph of groups 
is the amalgamated free product of \(n\) copies of \(S_3\) with a cyclic  group of order 2 amalgamated,
so has presentation&lt;/p&gt;

\[\langle a_1,\ldots, a_n,t : a_1^3 = \cdots = a_n^3 = t^2 = 1,\ ta_it^{-1} = a_i^{-1} \rangle.\]

&lt;p&gt;In terms of this presentation, each \(\iota_e(\mathcal{G}_e)\) is the cyclic group \(\langle t\rangle\).
This subgroup is its own normalizer in \(\pi_1(\mathcal{G})\).
Perhaps the easiest way to see this is to note that the fixed-point set of \(t\)
on the Bass–Serre tree of \(\mathcal{G}\) is finite:
it includes one whole fundamental domain of the action but can go no further.
Since the normalizer preserves the fixed-point set, it must be finite.
Therefore the sufficient condition of Pettet mentioned above applies,
and we conclude \(\operatorname{Out}(\pi_1(\mathcal{G}))\) is finite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, \(\mathcal{G}\) contains &lt;em&gt;ideal edges&lt;/em&gt; in the sense of the previous post.
The idea is that given any subset (including all) 
of the \(n-1\) oriented edges incident to the center vertex,
we can create a new graph of groups by pulling those edges away from the center vertex
and attach them to a new vertex whose vertex group will be cyclic of order 2.
Nothing prevents us from continuing this process
until the resulting graph of groups \(\mathcal{G}&apos;\)
has all interior vertices trivalent with \(C_2\) vertex group,
all leaf vertices with \(S_3\) vertex group,
and all edge groups \(C_2\).
At this stage, an Euler characteristic argument shows that \(\mathcal{G}&apos;\) has \(n-2\) vertices 
with \(C_2\) vertex group,
while \(\mathcal{G}\) had none.
A chain of \(n-2\) edge collapses recovering \(\mathcal{G}\) from \(\mathcal{G}&apos;\)
shows that the complex studied by Krstić and Vogtmann has dimension at least (and in fact equal to) \(n-2\).
Thus  we have shown that Krstić and Vogtmann’s complex
can overestimate the &lt;em&gt;virtual cohomological dimension&lt;/em&gt;
of \(\operatorname{Out}(\pi_1(\mathcal{G}))\) by an arbitrary amount,
since the virtual cohomological dimension of a finite group is zero.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Martin Pettet characterized which virtually free groups have finite outer automorphism group.

In the &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/03/26/Shelters-in-graphs-of-groups.html&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; we defined what it meant for an edge of \(T\) 
to be &lt;em&gt;surviving&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;collapsible.&lt;/em&gt;
Collapsing orbits of collapsible edges in \(T\) yields
a new tree \(T&apos;\) which we say is obtained from \(T\) by forest collapse.
Two trees \(T\) and \(T&apos;\) are in the same &lt;em&gt;deformation space&lt;/em&gt;
if there are \(G\)-equivariant maps \(T \to T&apos;\) and \(T&apos; \to T\).
The set of \(G\)-equivariant homeomorphism classes of trees in the same deformation space as \(T\)
all of whose edges are surviving
is partially ordered under the operation of forest collapse,
and this partial order contains minimal elements, which are &lt;em&gt;reduced&lt;/em&gt; trees.
To study this poset, or its geometric realization \(L_T(G)\),
it would be convenient to understand all trees collapsing onto a given reduced tree.
This is captured in the idea of an &lt;em&gt;ideal edge,&lt;/em&gt;
which I’d like to describe in this post.
The idea of an ideal edge goes back to Culler and Vogtmann’s
&lt;a href=&quot;https://marc-culler.info/static/home/papers/OuterSpace.pdf&quot;&gt;original paper&lt;/a&gt; on Outer Space;
the treatment here is adapted from a paper of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226534036_Equivariant_outer_space_and_automorphisms_of_free-by-finite_groups/link/5762c70508aee61395bef5dc/download&quot;&gt;Krstić and Vogtmann&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again we will work in the quotient graph of groups \(\mathcal{G}\),
the construction of which we described in the &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/03/26/Shelters-in-graphs-of-groups.html&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;.
We assume that \(\mathcal{G}\) is finite and connected,
and that if a vertex \(v\) has valence less than 3,
then at least one of the edge-to-vertex group inclusions 
\(\iota_e\colon\mathcal{G}_e \to \mathcal{G}_v\) is not surjective.
In tree language this says that \(T\) is minimal and has no subdivision vertices.
The graph of groups \(\mathcal{G}\) is &lt;em&gt;marked.&lt;/em&gt;
If we fix a tree \(T\) in the deformation space
and identify \(G\) with the fundamental group of its quotient graph of groups \(\mathbb{G}\),
we may think of the marking as a &lt;em&gt;homotopy equivalence&lt;/em&gt; in the sense of &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02848&quot;&gt;my paper&lt;/a&gt;
\(\sigma\colon \mathbb{G} \to \mathcal{G}\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;directions&quot;&gt;Directions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let \(v\) be a vertex of \(\mathcal{G}\).
Let \(\operatorname{st}(v)\) be the set of oriented edges of \(\mathcal{G}\) 
with initial vertex \(v\).
The set of &lt;em&gt;directions&lt;/em&gt; at \(v\), denoted \(D_v\), is the set&lt;/p&gt;

\[\coprod_{e \in \operatorname{st}(v)} \mathcal{G}_v/\iota_e(\mathcal{G}_e) \times \{e\}.\]

&lt;p&gt;The group \(\mathcal{G}_v\) acts on \(D_v\) on the left,
and under the identification of \(\mathcal{G}\) with the quotient graph of groups of \(T\),
if \(\tilde v\) is a lift of \(v\) to \(T\),
there is a \(\mathcal{G}_v\)-equivariant bijection 
between \(D_v\) and the set \(\operatorname{st}(\tilde v)\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose \(T&apos;\) is a tree such that collapsing the orbit of an edge \(\tilde e\) incident to \(v\)
yields a tree equivariantly homeomorphic to \(T\).
If we suppose that \(T&apos;\) is minimal, has no subdivision vertices
and that every edge of \(T&apos;\) is surviving,
we can make the following observations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;\(\tilde e\) separates \(\operatorname{st}(\tilde v)\) into two components,
each of which has at least two edges, since \(T&apos;\) is minimal
and has no subdivision vertices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The stabilizer of \(\tilde e\) is a subgroup of the stabilizer of \(\tilde v\)
and is equal to the stabilizer of the new vertex \(\tilde w\).
If an edge in \(\operatorname{st}(\tilde v)\) now has initial vertex \(\tilde w\),
so does every edge in its \(\operatorname{stab}(\tilde e)\)-orbit and no others.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Since \(\tilde e\) is surviving, another edge incident to \(\tilde w\) must be collapsible;
in other words \(\operatorname{stab}(\tilde e) = \operatorname{stab}(\tilde e&apos;)\)
for some edge \(\tilde e&apos;\) with initial vertex \(\tilde w\).
For the edge \(\tilde e&apos;\) to be collapsible,
we need that its terminal vertex is not in the orbit of \(\tilde w\).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore conversely, if we have a subset of \(\operatorname{st}(\tilde v)\)
satisfying the above three properties,
we can “blow up” the tree \(T\), inserting a new edge orbit \(\tilde e\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ideal-edges&quot;&gt;Ideal edges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of an ideal edge in \(\mathcal{G}\) is designed to capture the above observations.
To wit, an &lt;em&gt;ideal edge&lt;/em&gt; based at a vertex \(v\) is a subset \(\alpha \subset D_v\)
that is required to satisfy the following conditions.
Let \(\mathcal{G}_\alpha\) be the subgroup of \(\mathcal{G}_v\)
generated by the subgroups \(g\iota_e(\mathcal{G}_e)g^{-1}\)
for each direction \((g\iota_e(\mathcal{G}_e),e)\) contained in \(\alpha\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are at least two directions in \(\alpha\) and at least two directions not in \(\alpha\).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If \((g\iota_e(\mathcal{G}_e),e) \in \alpha\),
then the intersection \(\mathcal{G}_v(g\iota_e(\mathcal{G}_e),e) \cap \alpha\) equals
\(\mathcal{G}_\alpha(g\iota_e(\mathcal{G}_e),e)\).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The subgroup \(\mathcal{G}_\alpha\) is equal to \(g\iota_e(\mathcal{G}_e)g^{-1}\)
for some direction \((g\iota_e(\mathcal{G}_e),e) \in \alpha\)
and no direction with underlying oriented edge \(\bar e\) is in \(\alpha\).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will say an oriented edge \(e \in \alpha\) if there is some direction
in \(\alpha\) with underlying oriented edge \(e\).
Notice that it follows from the conditions that \(\alpha\) contains at least two oriented edges.
Let \(D(\alpha)\) be the set of oriented edges supporting a direction
satisfying the third item above.
If \(\mathcal{G}\) is reduced and \(\alpha\) is an ideal edge 
satisfying \(\mathcal{G}_\alpha = \mathcal{G}_v\),
then \(D_v - \alpha\) is also an ideal edge.
The first item in the definition is clear.
The second says that for each oriented edge \(e \in \operatorname{st}(v)\),
either all directions with underlying oriented edge \(e\) are in \(\alpha\) or none are,
which is also true of \(D_v - \alpha\).
Since \(\mathcal{G}\) is reduced, some and hence every edge \(e \in D(\alpha)\)
must form a loop based at \(v\) (for otherwise we could collapse \(e\)),
so we have \(\bar e \in D(D_v - \alpha)\).
We call \(D_v - \alpha\) the &lt;em&gt;inverse&lt;/em&gt; of \(\alpha\).
Two ideal edges \(\alpha\) and \(\alpha&apos;\) are &lt;em&gt;equivalent&lt;/em&gt;
if there exists \(g \in \mathcal{G}_v\) such that \(g.\alpha = \alpha&apos;\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ideal edge \(\alpha\) based at \(v\) is &lt;em&gt;contained in&lt;/em&gt; an ideal edge \(\beta\)
if there exists \(g \in \mathcal{G}_v\)
such that \(g.\alpha \subset \beta\).
If \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are based at \(v\),
the ideal edges are &lt;em&gt;disjoint&lt;/em&gt; if \(g.\alpha \cap \beta = \varnothing\) 
for all \(g \in \mathcal{G}_v\).
If \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are based at different vertices, then they are disjoint.
We say \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are &lt;em&gt;compatible&lt;/em&gt;
if one is properly contained in the other or if they are disjoint and not inverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;blowing-up-ideal-edges&quot;&gt;Blowing up ideal edges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/idealedge.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Blowing up an ideal edge in a graph of groups&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let \(\alpha\) be an ideal edge of the marked graph of groups \(\tau = (\mathcal{G},\sigma)\).
We construct a new marked graph of groups \(\tau^\alpha = (\mathcal{G}^\alpha,\sigma^\alpha)\)
by &lt;em&gt;blowing up&lt;/em&gt; \(\alpha\) as follows.
The vertices and edges of \(\mathcal{G}^\alpha\) 
are the same as the vertices and edges of \(\mathcal{G}\)
with one new vertex \(v_\alpha\) and one new edge \(\alpha\);
the other vertices and edges are &lt;em&gt;old.&lt;/em&gt;
The old vertex and edge groups are equal to what they are in \(\mathcal{G}\).
We have \(\mathcal{G}^\alpha_{v_\alpha} = \mathcal{G}_\alpha = \mathcal{G}^\alpha_\alpha\).
The new edge \(\alpha\) begins at \(v_\alpha\) and ends at \(v\).
If \(e\) is an old oriented edge in \(\alpha\),
then \(e\) now has initial vertex \(v_\alpha\)
and the inclusion \(\iota_e\colon \mathcal{G}^\alpha_e \to \mathcal{G}^\alpha_\alpha\)
is obtained from \(\iota_e\colon \mathcal{G}_e \to \mathcal{G}_v\)
by recalling that we have \(g\iota_e(\mathcal{G_e})g^{-1} \le \mathcal{G}_\alpha\)
for some \(g \in \mathcal{G}_v\).
Note that there is a choice here of group element \(g\);
differing choices will yield &lt;em&gt;equivalent&lt;/em&gt; markings in a sense that I won’t make precise here.
All other oriented edges have their initial vertices and edge-to-vertex group inclusions unchanged.
There is a &lt;em&gt;collapse map&lt;/em&gt; \(\mathcal{G}^\alpha \to \mathcal{G}\)
defined by collapsing the edge \(\alpha\) and then “twisting” the edges incident to \(v_\alpha\)
by the corresponding choice of group element \(g \in \mathcal{G}_v\).
We’ll describe maps of general graphs of groups in another post.
Choose a homotopy inverse \(f\colon \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{G}^\alpha\)
and define \(\sigma^\alpha = f\sigma\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observe that if \(\beta\) is disjoint from (and not inverse to)
or properly included in \(\alpha\),
then \(\beta\) may be regarded as an ideal edge of \(\mathcal{G}^\alpha\).
If \(\alpha\) are disjoint and not inverse, it’s not hard to see that
\((\tau^\alpha)^\beta = (\tau^\beta)^\alpha\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;em&gt;oriented ideal forest&lt;/em&gt; in a marked graph of groups \(\tau\)
is a collection of equivalence classes \(\{\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k\}\)
of ideal edges in \(\tau\) that are pairwise compatible.
The ideal edges in an oriented ideal forest are partially ordered under inclusion.
By repeatedly blowing up maximal elements of this partial order,
we obtain a marked graph of groups \(\tau^{\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k}\).
Because each ideal edge \(\alpha\) in a reduced marked graph of groups \(\tau\)
has an oriented edge in \(D(\alpha)\),
it follows that each edge of \(\tau^{\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k}\) is surviving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pair of ideal edges \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are &lt;em&gt;pre-compatible&lt;/em&gt;
if they are compatible, or \(\alpha\) is invertible with inverse \(\bar\alpha\)
and \(\bar\alpha\) is included in \(\beta\).
It follows that \(\beta\) is invertible and that \(\bar\beta\) is included in \(\alpha\).
An &lt;em&gt;ideal forest&lt;/em&gt; is a collection of pairwise pre-compatible ideal edges
containing the inverse of each of its invertible elements.
We can complete each oriented ideal forest \(\Phi\) to an ideal forest \(\Phi^\pm\) by adding
the inverses of each of its invertible elements.
Krstić and Vogtmann prove for graphs of finite groups
as Lemma 5.7 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226534036_Equivariant_outer_space_and_automorphisms_of_free-by-finite_groups/link/5762c70508aee61395bef5dc/download&quot;&gt;their paper&lt;/a&gt;
that if \(\Phi^\pm = \Psi^\pm\) as ideal forests
in a reduced marked graph of groups \(\tau\),
we have \(\tau^\Phi = \tau^\Psi\) as marked graphs of groups.
Again for graphs of finite groups,
Krstić and Vogtmann prove as Proposition 5.9 that the poset of marked graphs of groups in \(L_T(G)\)
collapsing to a reduced marked graph of groups \(\tau\) 
is isomorphic to the poset of ideal forests in \(\tau\).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Let’s once again fix a group \(G\) that acts cocompactly on a tree \(T\).

&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0107008&quot;&gt;Forester&lt;/a&gt; introduced the notion of a &lt;em&gt;deformation&lt;/em&gt; of the tree \(T\)
and &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0605545&quot;&gt;Guirardel and Levitt&lt;/a&gt; studied the &lt;em&gt;deformation space&lt;/em&gt;
\(\mathscr{D}\) consisting of trees obtainable from \(T\) by a finite sequence of deformations.
Usually we assume \(G\) to be finitely generated,
but it’s not clear to me how often this assumption is necessary.
Maybe that’ll be a topic for another blog post.
In this post I want to discuss the notion of a &lt;em&gt;shelter,&lt;/em&gt;
which Guirardel and Levitt (and also &lt;a href=&quot;https://mattclay.hosted.uark.edu/Papers/def.pdf&quot;&gt;Clay&lt;/a&gt;) 
use to construct a deformation retraction of \(\mathscr{D}\) (or its simplicial spine)
onto a smaller, often finite-dimensional, space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-quotient-graph-of-groups&quot;&gt;The quotient graph of groups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a group \(G\) acting on a graph \(\Gamma\),
there is a notion of a &lt;em&gt;quotient graph of groups,&lt;/em&gt; 
which I’d like to describe once and for all here.
Let me remind you that a &lt;em&gt;graph of groups&lt;/em&gt; 
is a graph, which I’ll call \(\mathcal{G}\),
together with an assignment of groups \(\mathcal{G}_v\) and \(\mathcal{G}_e\)
to each vertex \(v\) and edge \(e\) of \(\mathcal{G}\),
along with injective homomorphisms \(\iota_e \colon \mathcal{G}_e \to \mathcal{G}_v\)
whenever \(v\) is the terminal vertex of the oriented edge \(e\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, suppose we have \(G\) acting on \(\Gamma\).
I want this action to be essentially combinatorial,
in the sense that we can think of \(\Gamma\) as having a set of vertices and a set of edges,
and \(G\) permutes the elements of those sets preserving adjacency.
Making this precise is surprisingly exhausting 
(“fix a homeomorphism between each closed edge…”), so I won’t.
By \(G\)-equivariantly subdividing certain orbits of edges,
we may suppose that the action is &lt;em&gt;without inversions in edges,&lt;/em&gt;
which means that if a group element preserves an edge \(e\) of \(\Gamma\),
then it fixes each vertex incident to \(e\).
The advantage of this condition is that the quotient \(G\backslash\Gamma\)
then inherits the structure of a graph, call it \(\mathcal{G}\).
To make \(\mathcal{G}\) into a graph of groups, we need groups and homomorphisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So fix connected subgraphs \(S_0 \subset S_1 \subset \Gamma\)
with the property that the natural projection \(p\colon \Gamma \to \mathcal{G}\)
restricts to a bijection on the set of vertices of \(S_0\)
and a bijection on the set of edges of \(S_1\).
In other words, \(S_1\) is a &lt;em&gt;fundamental domain&lt;/em&gt; for the action of \(G\) on \(\Gamma\),
and if we assume \(S_0\) is a minimal subgraph of \(S_1\) with the defining property,
it follows that \(S_0\) projects to a &lt;em&gt;spanning tree&lt;/em&gt; of \(\mathcal{G}\).
For a vertex \(v\) and an edge \(e\) of \(\mathcal{G}\), 
write \(\tilde v\) and \(\tilde e\) for its unique preimage in \(S_0\) and \(S_1\) respectively.
For each oriented edge \(e\) of \(\mathcal{G}\),
choose a group element \(g_e \in G\)
with the following property:
if \(x\) is the terminal vertex of \(\tilde e\) and \(p(x) = v\),
we have that \(g_e.x = \tilde v\).
Furthermore, if \(x = \tilde v\), choose \(g_e = 1\).
The groups \(\mathcal{G}_v\) and \(\mathcal{G}_e\)
are the stabilizers in \(G\) of \(\tilde v\) and \(\tilde e\) respectively,
and the injective homomorphism \(\iota_e \colon \mathcal{G}_e \to \mathcal{G}_v\)
is the restriction of the map \(h \mapsto g_e h g_e^{-1}\) to \(\mathcal{G}_e\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;properties-of-the-tree-in-the-quotient&quot;&gt;Properties of the tree in the quotient&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s return to the situation of our group \(G\) acting cocompactly on a tree \(T\).
Then the quotient graph of groups \(\mathcal{G}\) is finite and connected.
We assume the action is &lt;em&gt;minimal,&lt;/em&gt;
in the sense that there is no \(G\)-invariant subtree.
In the quotient graph of groups \(\mathcal{G}\),
this is equivalent to the condition that no valence-one vertex \(v\)
has the property that the incident edge-to-vertex group inclusion is surjective.
We also assume that \(T\) has no &lt;em&gt;subdivision vertices,&lt;/em&gt;
i.e. that a valence-two vertex of \(T\) has the property
that the incident edges are in the same \(G\)-orbit.
In the quotient graph of groups \(\mathcal{G}\),
this is equivalent to the condition that no valence-two vertex \(v\)
has the property that both incident edge-to-vertex group inclusions are surjective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A general fact about automorphisms of simplicial trees
(in fact, isometries of real trees)
is that each automorphism (isometry) is either &lt;em&gt;elliptic,&lt;/em&gt;
i.e. fixes a point of the tree
or &lt;em&gt;hyperbolic&lt;/em&gt;
i.e. there is an embedded copy of \(\mathbb{R}\) called the &lt;em&gt;axis&lt;/em&gt; in the tree
that is preserved by the automorphism (isometry) and along which
the automorphism (isometry) acts by translation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An edge \(\tilde e\) of \(T\) is &lt;em&gt;collapsible&lt;/em&gt; if collapsing each edge in its orbit to a point
does not change the partition of elements of \(G\) into hyperbolic and elliptic elements.
Equivalently, the \(G\)-orbit of \(\tilde e\) must not contain the axis of a hyperbolic element.
In the quotient graph of groups, we must have that the endpoints of \(p(\tilde e) = e\)
are distinct and that at least one of the edge-to-vertex group inclusions is surjective.
If \(\tilde e\) is collapsible, collapsing each edge in its orbit to a point
yields a new tree \(T&apos;\) in the same deformation space as \(T\).
In &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02848&quot;&gt;my paper&lt;/a&gt;, I describe this as a &lt;em&gt;collapse map&lt;/em&gt;
of the quotient graphs of groups which is a &lt;em&gt;homotopy equivalence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tree \(T\) is &lt;em&gt;reduced&lt;/em&gt; if is has no collapsible edges.
In the quotient graph of groups,
this says that if some edge-to-vertex group inclusion 
\(\iota_e\colon \mathcal{G}_e \to \mathcal{G}_v\) is surjective,
then the edge \(e\) forms a loop.
Every cocompact \(G\)-tree \(T\) may be made reduced by a finite sequence of collapse maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;shelters&quot;&gt;Shelters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An edge \(\tilde e\) in a tree \(T\) is &lt;em&gt;surviving&lt;/em&gt;
if there is a reduced tree \(T&apos;\) and a product of collapse maps \(T \to T&apos;\)
with the property that the edge \(\tilde e\) is not collapsed.
The deformation retraction mentioned in the first paragraph
consists of those trees all of whose edges are surviving.
For the reader familiar with Culler–Vogtmann Outer Space,
it’s not hard to see that a tree in Outer Space has the property that every edge is surviving
if and only if the quotient graph has no separating edges.
The concept of a &lt;em&gt;shelter&lt;/em&gt; generalizes this “no separating edges” condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let \(\mathcal{G}\) be the quotient graph of groups.
Label each half-edge of \(\mathcal{G}\) by \(=\) or \(\neq\)
according to whether the corresponding edge-to-vertex group inclusion
is surjective or non-surjective, respectively.
An embedded segment or circle \(\gamma\) in \(\mathcal{G}\) is a &lt;em&gt;shelter&lt;/em&gt;
if it satisfies one of the following properties:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\(\gamma\) is a segment with \(\ne\) at each of its endpoints
and \(=\) otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\(\gamma\) is a circle with two \(=\) labels at all of its vertices 
with the possible exception of one.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;\(\gamma\) is a circle, and there is an orientation of \(\gamma\) such that
all positively oriented edges have \(=\) at their endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

The quotient of a free splitting \(T\) of \(F\) by the action of \(F\)
is a &lt;em&gt;graph of groups with trivial edge groups.&lt;/em&gt;
The purpose of this post is to introduce &lt;em&gt;maps&lt;/em&gt; of graphs of groups with trivial edge groups
and explore lifting maps of the quotient graph of groups to twisted equivariant maps 
of the tree \(T\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;graphs-of-groups-with-trivial-edge-groups&quot;&gt;Graphs of groups with trivial edge groups&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let \(G\) be a finite graph.
The structure of a &lt;em&gt;graph of groups with trivial edge groups&lt;/em&gt; on \(G\)
is the assignment, for each vertex \(v\) of \(G\), of a group \(\mathcal{G}_v\).
We write \(\mathcal{G}\) for the graph of groups.
Associated to \(\mathcal{G}\) we can form a &lt;em&gt;graph of spaces&lt;/em&gt; \(X_{\mathcal{G}}\) à la Scott and Wall.
For each vertex \(v\) of \(G\), take a CW complex \(X_v\) with one vertex \(\star_v\)
that is a \(K(\mathcal{G}_v,1)\).
The space \(X_{\mathcal{G}}\) is formed from the disjoint union of these CW complexes
by adding, for each edge \(e\) of \(G\) with initial vertex \(v\) and terminal vertex \(w\),
an edge connecting \(\star_v\) to \(\star_w\).
There is a natural “retraction” \(r\colon X_{\mathcal{G}} \to G\) 
that collapses each \(K(\mathcal{G}_v,1)\)
to the vertex \(\star_v\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;fundamental group of the graph of groups \(\mathcal{G}\)&lt;/em&gt;
is the fundamental group of the graph of spaces \(X_{\mathcal{G}}\).
If we choose a basepoint \(p \in X_{\mathcal{G}}\) in the image of the retraction,
we may homotope each element of \(\pi_1(X_{\mathcal{G}},p)\) into the \(1\)-skeleton,
and further to an &lt;em&gt;edge path in \(\mathcal{G}\)&lt;/em&gt; of the form&lt;/p&gt;

\[\gamma = e&apos;_1g_1e_2g_2\ldots e_kg_ke&apos;_{k+1},\]

&lt;p&gt;where \(e&apos;_1\) and \(e&apos;_{k+1}\) are terminal and initial segments 
of oriented edges \(e_1\) and \(e_{k+1}\) of \(G\),
respectively, where \(e_2,\ldots,e_k\) are oriented edges of \(G\),
where \(g_i\) for \(1 \le i \le k\) is an element of \(\mathcal{G}_{v_i} = \pi_1(X_{v_i},\star_{v_i})\),
and where \(v_i\) is the terminal vertex of the edge \(e_i\) 
and the initial vertex of the edge \(e_{i+1}\).
Notice that this notion makes sense without reference to \(X_{\mathcal{G}}\).
Homotopy rel endpoints for edge paths in \(\mathcal{G}\) has a combinatorial flavor
that makes no reference to \(X_{\mathcal{G}}\):
it is generated by performing multiplication or factoring in vertex groups
and adding or removing subpaths of the form \(e \bar e\), where \(\bar e\) is the edge 
\(e\) in its opposite orientation.
An edge path is &lt;em&gt;tight&lt;/em&gt; if the number of edges in the path cannot be decreased by a homotopy.
Every edge path is homotopic to a unique tight path (which may contain no edges).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bass–Serre theory asserts that \(F = \pi_1(\mathcal{G},p) = \pi_1(X_{\mathcal{G}},p)\)
is a free product of the form&lt;/p&gt;

\[F = A_1 * \cdots * A_n * F_k,\]

&lt;p&gt;Where the \(A_i\) are the nontrivial vertex groups of \(\mathcal{G}\)
and \(F_k\), a free group of rank \(k\),
is the ordinary fundamental group of \(G\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bassserre-tree&quot;&gt;The Bass–Serre tree&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given a graph of groups with trivial edge groups \(\mathcal{G}\)
and a point \(p \in G\),
we wish to define a free splitting \(\Gamma\) of \(F\) equipped with a basepoint \(\tilde p\)
called the &lt;em&gt;Bass–Serre tree&lt;/em&gt; of \(\mathcal{G}\).
Given a vertex \(v\) of \(G\), write \([p,v]\) for the set of homotopy classes
of edge paths in \(\mathcal{G}\) beginning at \(p\) and ending at \(v\).
There is a natural right action of \(\mathcal{G}_v\) on \([p,v]\)
defined by \(\gamma.g = \gamma g\).
Let \(V\) be the set of vertices of \(G\).
The vertex set of \(\Gamma\) 
is the set&lt;/p&gt;

\[\coprod_{v \in V}[p,v]/\mathcal{G}_v.\]

&lt;p&gt;Two vertices \([\gamma] \mathcal{G}_v\) and \([\gamma&apos;]\mathcal{G}_w\)
are adjacent in \(\Gamma\) if and only if the path
\(\bar\gamma\gamma&apos;\) is homotopic to a path of the form \(g e g&apos;\),
i.e. a path of length one.
One can check that this is well-defined independent of the choice of representatives
\(\gamma\) and \(\gamma&apos;\).
There is a natural action of \(F = \pi_1(\mathcal{G},p)\) on \(\Gamma\)
defined as \([\gamma].[\sigma]\mathcal{G}_v = [\gamma\sigma]\mathcal{G}_v\).
The fundamental theorem of Bass–Serre theory
asserts that \(\Gamma\) is a tree, that the \(F\)-action has trivial edge stabilizers,
and that the “quotient graph of groups” \(F\backslash\backslash\Gamma\),
which I won’t describe here,
is naturally identified with \(\mathcal{G}\).
Let \(\pi\colon \Gamma \to G\) be the natural projection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose \(\gamma\) is a tight path in \(\mathcal{G}\) beginning at a vertex \(v\)
and ending at a vertex \(w\).
A lift \(\tilde v\) of \(v\) to \(\Gamma\) is determined by a tight path \(\sigma\) from \(p\) to \(v\).
The path \(\gamma\) lifts uniquely to a tight path \(\tilde\gamma\) in \(\Gamma\) 
beginning at \(\tilde v\):
it is the unique tight path connecting the vertex \([\sigma]\mathcal{G}_v\) to the vertex
\([\sigma\gamma]\mathcal{G}_w\).
More generally it is possible to lift edge paths that are not tight
or do not begin and end at vertices.
In particular lifting the trivial path at \(p\) defines a basepoint \(\tilde p\) in \(\Gamma\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;maps-of-graphs-of-groups-with-trivial-edge-groups&quot;&gt;Maps of graphs of groups with trivial edge groups&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let \(\mathcal{G}\) be a graph of groups with trivial edge groups
and \(X_{\mathcal{G}}\) an associated graph of spaces.
A &lt;em&gt;map of graphs of groups with trivial edge groups&lt;/em&gt;
\(f\colon \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{G}\)
is a pair of maps \(f_X\colon X_{\mathcal{G}} \to X_{\mathcal{G}}\)
and \(f\colon G \to G\) such that the following diagram commutes&lt;/p&gt;

\[\require{AMScd}\begin{CD}
X_{\mathcal{G}} @&amp;gt;f_X&amp;gt;&amp;gt; X_{\mathcal{G}} \\
@VrVV @VVrV \\
G @&amp;gt;f&amp;gt;&amp;gt; G.
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;homotopy&lt;/em&gt; of maps of graphs of groups with trivial edge groups
is a pair of homotopies such that the relevant diagram commutes.
A map \(f\colon \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{G}\) is a &lt;em&gt;homotopy equivalence&lt;/em&gt;
if, as usual, there is a map \(g\colon \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{G}\)
such that \(gf\) and \(fg\) are each homotopic to the identity map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not too hard to see that each map \(f\colon \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{G}\)
is homotopic to one that sends the vertices \(\star_v\) of \(X_{\mathcal{G}}\)
to vertices of \(X_{\mathcal{G}}\)
and further sends edges of \(G \subset X_{\mathcal{G}}\)
to (possibly trivial) edge paths in \(\mathcal{G}\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like edge paths, a map of graphs of groups with trivial edge groups
that is a homotopy equivalence has a combinatorial shadow in \(\mathcal{G}\)
that does not depend on \(X_{\mathcal{G}}\):
the data of \(f\) is a continuous map \(f\colon G \to G\)
taking vertices to vertices and edges to edge paths,
along with for each edge \(e\) of \(G\),
an edge path \(f(e)\) in \(\mathcal{G}\),
and for each vertex \(v\) of \(G\) with nontrivial vertex group,
an isomorphism \(f_v\colon \mathcal{G}_v \to \mathcal{G}_{f(v)}\).
Homotopy for maps of graphs of groups has a combinatorial shadow in \(\mathcal{G}\) as well;
I won’t describe it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose \(f\colon \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{G}\) is a homotopy equivalence
of the form above.
Given a basepoint \(p \in G\) and a path \(\sigma\) from \(p\) to \(f(p)\),
the homotopy equivalence \(f\) induces an automorphism
\(\Phi \colon \pi_1(\mathcal{G},p) \to \pi_1(\mathcal{G},p)\) by the rule&lt;/p&gt;

\[\Phi([\gamma]) = [\sigma f(\gamma) \bar\sigma].\]

&lt;p&gt;If \(\Gamma\) is the Bass–Serre tree of \(\mathcal{G}\) with basepoint \(\tilde p\) lifting \(p\),
the choice of path \(\sigma\) also defines a lift
\(\tilde f\colon \Gamma \to \Gamma\) defined as follows:
A point \(\tilde x\) of \(\Gamma\) is determined by an edge path \(\gamma\) in \(\mathcal{G}\)
beginning at \(p\):
if \(\tilde x\) is a vertex, the path \(\gamma\) is any path in the \(\mathcal{G}_x\)-orbit
\([\gamma]\mathcal{G}_x\) determining \(\tilde x\).
In this case, the point \(\tilde f(\tilde x)\) is \([\sigma f(\gamma)]\mathcal{G}_{f(x)}\).
One checks that this is independent of the choice of \(\gamma\).
This can be extended to define \(\tilde f\) for points that are not vertices.
The map \(\tilde f\) is \(\Phi\)-&lt;em&gt;twisted equivariant&lt;/em&gt; in the sense that&lt;/p&gt;

\[\tilde f(g.\tilde x) = \Phi(g).\tilde f(\tilde x)\]

&lt;p&gt;for each point \(\tilde x \in \Gamma\) and element \(g\) of \(\pi_1(\mathcal{G},p)\).
We say that \(\tilde f\) &lt;em&gt;corresponds to \(\Phi\).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-little-about-the-map-dtilde-f&quot;&gt;A little about the map \(D\tilde f\)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing notation from the previous paragraph,
let \(\tilde v\) be the vertex \([\gamma]\mathcal{G}_v\) of \(\Gamma\).
Suppose the final vertex group element of \(\gamma\) is trivial.
A lift \(\tilde f\colon \Gamma \to \Gamma\) of \(f\)
determined by the choice of path \(\sigma\) from \(p\) to \(f(p)\)
satisfies \(\tilde f(\tilde v) = \tilde v\) if and only if
\(f\) fixes \(v\) and
\(\sigma\) is homotopic to a path of the form \(\gamma h f(\bar\gamma)\) for \(h \in \mathcal{G}_v\).
A &lt;em&gt;direction at \(\tilde v\)&lt;/em&gt; is an edge \(\tilde e\) with initial vertex \(\tilde v\).
The map \(g \mapsto [\gamma g\bar\gamma]\) determines an isomorphism from \(\mathcal{G}_v\)
to the stabilizer of \(\tilde v\) in \(\pi_1(\mathcal{G},p)\).
Under this isomorphism there is a (left) action of \(\mathcal{G}_v\) 
on the set of directions based at \(\tilde v\).
Let \(\operatorname{st}(v)\) be the set of edges of \(G\) with initial vertex \(v\).
There is a \(\mathcal{G}_v\)-equivariant bijection from the set of directions based at \(\tilde v\)
with the set&lt;/p&gt;

\[\coprod_{e \in \operatorname{st}(v)} \mathcal{G}_v\times \{e\}\]

&lt;p&gt;defined as follows.
Let \(\tilde w\) be the terminal vertex of the edge \(\tilde e\).
The map sends \(\tilde e\) to the pair \((g,e)\)
if we have \(\tilde w = [\gamma ge]\mathcal{G}_w\).
The map \(\tilde f\colon \Gamma \to \Gamma\)
induces a map \(D\tilde f\) of the set of directions at \(\tilde v\)
as follows: \(D\tilde f(\tilde e)\) is the first edge on the edge path \(\tilde f(\tilde e)\).
We have&lt;/p&gt;

\[\tilde f(\tilde w) = [\sigma f(\gamma ge)]\mathcal{G}_{f(w)} 
= [\gamma h f(\bar\gamma)f(\gamma)f_v(g)f(e)]\mathcal{G}_{f(w)}
= [\gamma h f_v(g) f(e)]\mathcal{G}{f(w)}.\]

&lt;p&gt;If the edge path \(f(e)\) begins \(g_0 e_1\),
we see that \(D\tilde f(g,e) = (hf_v(g)g_0,e_1)\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-latest-point-of-confusion&quot;&gt;My latest point of confusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose \(\tilde v\) has infinite valence,
or equivalently that the group \(\mathcal{G}_v\) is infinite.
Let’s assume \(\mathcal{G}_v\) is countable.
To get the result that I want, I’m happy to restrict further,
and I’m particularly interested in the case where \(\mathcal{G}_v\) is virtually finite-rank free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose \(\tilde f\) is a lift of \(f\colon \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{G}\) that fixes \(\tilde v\).
We say that \(\tilde f\) is &lt;em&gt;principal&lt;/em&gt; if \(\operatorname{Fix}(\tilde f)\) contains at least two points
or if \(D\tilde f\) fixes a direction based at \(\tilde v\).
Two lifts \(\tilde f\) and \(\tilde f&apos;\) fixing \(\tilde v\) 
corresponding to elements \(h\) and \(h&apos;\) in \(\mathcal{G}_v\)
are &lt;em&gt;isogredient&lt;/em&gt;
if there exists \(c \in \mathcal{G}_v\) such that
the maps \(D\tilde f\) and \(D\tilde f&apos;\) satisfy \(D\tilde f&apos; = c D\tilde f c^{-1}\):
that is,
for a direction \((x,e)\),
we have \((h&apos; f_v(x) g_0,e_1) = (ch f_v(c^{-1}) f_v(x) g_0,e_1)\),
which holds if and only if \(h&apos; = ch f_v(c^{-1})\).
It’s not too hard to see that if \((x,e)\) is a fixed direction for \(D \tilde f\),
then \(cx\) is a fixed direction for \(D\tilde f&apos;\),
or more generally if \((x,e)\) is a periodic direction for \(D\tilde f\),
then \(cx\) is a periodic direction for \(D\tilde f&apos;\).
We are interested in principal lifts up to isogredience,
so we may simplify things by noting that up to isogredience, if there is a fixed point,
we may assume that it is of the form \((1,e)\).
In this case, we have&lt;/p&gt;

\[D\tilde f(1,e) = (hg_0,e),\]

&lt;p&gt;so we conclude that \(h = g_0^{-1}\).
Therefore up to isogredience, fixed directions are pretty simple.
Periodic directions are a little more complicated: 
assuming that \(e_1 = e\),
the condition that \((1,e)\) is mapped to itself by \(D\tilde f^k\)
is that&lt;/p&gt;

\[h f_v(h)f_v^2(h)\ldots f_v^{k-1}(h)f_v^{k-1}(g_0)f_v^{k-2}(g_0) \ldots f_v(g_0)g_0 = 1.\]

&lt;p&gt;What I want is sufficient conditions on \(\mathcal{G}_v\)
to guarantee the existence of \(k &amp;gt; 0\) independent of the choice of lift \(\tilde f\)
such that if \(D\tilde f^k\) has a periodic direction,
then that direction is fixed.
As already noted, we may simplify up to isogredience by assuming that the identity is periodic.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">In the previous post, we defined free splittings for a group \(F\).

A &lt;em&gt;free splitting&lt;/em&gt; of \(F\) is a simplicial tree \(T\)
equipped with an \(F\)-action
such that edge stabilizers are trivial.
I’ve been thinking a lot about free splittings;
here are some of my musings.
There isn’t really a punch line here,
but since it was clarifying to write this, I may as well post it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are interested in free splittings where there are finitely many orbits of edges
and some vertex has infinite stabilizer.
In this case, Bass–Serre theory shows that \(F\)
is a free product of the form&lt;/p&gt;

\[F = A_1*\cdots*A_n*F_k\]

&lt;p&gt;where the \(A_i\) are countable groups
(at least one of which is infinite)
and \(F_k\) is a free group of finite rank \(k\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-gromov-boundary-of-t&quot;&gt;The Gromov boundary of \(T\)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fix a basepoint \(p \in T\).
A &lt;em&gt;geodesic ray&lt;/em&gt; in \(T\) based at \(p\)
is a proper embedding \(\xi\colon [0,\infty) \to T\)
such that \(\xi(0) = p\).
We are really interested in the image of \(\xi\) more than the map.
Similarly we have &lt;em&gt;geodesics;&lt;/em&gt; embeddings \([0,1] \to T\).
Every path in \(T\) is homotopic rel endpoints to a unique geodesic or to a constant map.
Let \(\partial_\infty T\) denote the set of geodesic rays in \(T\) based at \(p\).
This is the &lt;em&gt;Gromov boundary&lt;/em&gt; of \(T\).
We may topologize \(T \cup \partial_\infty T\) by giving \(T\) the usual topology
and defining basic open neighborhoods of boundary points in the following way.
Given a boundary point \(\xi\), the basic open neighborhood is determined by a finite subpath
\(\gamma\) of the ray \(\xi\);
the basic open set \(N(\gamma)\) consists of those points \(x \in T \cup \partial_\infty T\)
such that the geodesic from \(p\) to \(x\) contains \(\gamma\).
In &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2021-07-25-Boundaries-of-free-splittings.html&quot;&gt;July&lt;/a&gt;, we showed that in our situation,
if all the groups \(A_i\) are countable and one is countably infinite,
then the Gromov boundary of \(T\) is homeomorphic (in the subspace topology) to the Baire space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-observers-topology&quot;&gt;The observer’s topology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may give \(T \cup \partial_\infty T\) a different topology
that makes it into a compact space:
this is the &lt;em&gt;observer’s topology,&lt;/em&gt; coined by &lt;a href=&quot;https://projecteuclid.org/journals/illinois-journal-of-mathematics/volume-51/issue-3/Non-unique-ergodicity-observers-topology-and-the-dual-algebraic-lamination/10.1215/ijm/1258131109.full&quot;&gt;Coulbois, Hilion and Lustig&lt;/a&gt;.
Let \(x \in T\) be a point.
A &lt;em&gt;half-tree&lt;/em&gt; based at \(x\) is a component of \(T \setminus \{x\}\).
A subbasis for the observer’s topology on \(T \cup \partial_\infty T\) 
is given by the set of half-trees;
where we say a boundary point \(\xi \in \partial_\infty T\) belongs to a half-tree
if the corresponding geodesic ray has infinite intersection with the half-tree.
In our situation, where the groups \(A_i\) are countable,
the tree \(T\) has countably many edges, so has a countable dense subset.
Since every point supports at most countably many half-trees,
it follows that the observer’s topology on \(T \cup \partial_\infty T\) is second countable.
Thus it makes sense to talk about the topology in terms of convergent sequences:
a sequence \(\{x_n\} \in T \cup \partial_\infty T\) converges to a point \(x\)
if for every point \(y \ne x\),
the points \(x_n\) belong to the same half-tree at \(y\) as \(x\) for \(n\) sufficiently large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coulbois, Hilion and Lustig show that \(T \cup \partial_\infty T\) is compact in the observer’s topology.
Here is their argument:
suppose \(\{x_n\}\) is a sequence,
and let \(\{U_i\}\) be a countable set of half-trees 
generating the topology on \(T \cup \partial_\infty T\)
For each \(U_i\), we may, after passing to a subsequence,
assume that \(x_n\) either belongs to \(U_i\) or not for \(n\) large.
Now note that the intersection of (the images of) two (distinct)
geodesics or geodesic rays based at \(p\)
is either a point or a geodesic.
Let \(\gamma_n\) denote the geodesic or geodesic ray from \(p\) to \(x_n\),
and consider the geodesic&lt;/p&gt;

\[I_k = \bigcap_{m \ge k} \gamma_m.\]

&lt;p&gt;Observe that \(I_k \subset I_{k+1}\), so&lt;/p&gt;

\[\overline{\bigcup_k I_k}\]

&lt;p&gt;is a geodesic or geodesic ray; let its endpoint be \(x\).
We will show that our subsequence \(\{x_n\}\) converges to \(x\).
Suppose for \(n \ge N\) we have that \(x_n \notin U_i\).
Then for any finite collection of such \(x_n\),
the subtree spanned by the collection is entirely outside \(U_i\),
since the (closed) complement of a half-tree is convex.
The nearest point to \(p\) belongs to this spanning subtree,
so inductively this shows that the endpoint of \(I_k\) is outside \(U_i\) for large \(k\).
It follows that \(x \notin U_i\). 
Therefore if \(x \in U_i\), then infinitely many,
and thus all but finitely many of the \(x_n\) belong to \(U_i\),
showing that the sequence \(\{x_n\}\) converges to \(x\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we would like to show that the topology induced on \(\partial_\infty T\)
agrees with the one above.
Suppose \(\{x_n\}\) converges to \(\xi \in \partial_\infty T\) in the observer’s topology,
so for any point \(y \in T\),
the points \(x_n\) belong to the same half-tree at \(y\) as \(\xi\) for \(n\) large.
Taking the points \(y\) to be on the geodesic ray \(\xi\)
shows that the geodesic or geodesic ray from \(p\) to \(x_n\)
must contain any finite subpath of \(\xi\) for \(n\) large.
If conversely the geodesic or geodesic ray from \(p\) to \(x_n\)
contains any finite subpath of \(\xi\) for \(n\) sufficiently large,
then if the intersection of the ray \(\xi\) with a given half-tree is infinite,
we may take a finite subpath \(\gamma\) so large that it ends inside the half-tree.
If the geodesic or geodesic ray from \(p\) to \(x_n\) contains \(\gamma\),
then since \(T\) is a tree, we conclude that \(x_n\) belongs to the half-tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bowditch-boundary-of-t&quot;&gt;The Bowditch Boundary of \(T\)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not hard to see that if \(x \in T\) is a point of finite valence,
(i.e. either a vertex of finite valence or a point in the interior of an edge)
then there is a basic open set containing \(x\) that contains only points of finite valence.
If we write \(V_\infty(T)\) for the set of vertices of infinite valence,
this argument shows that \(\partial T = \partial_\infty T \cup V_\infty(T)\)
is closed in the observer’s topology,
hence it is compact.
This is the &lt;em&gt;Bowditch boundary&lt;/em&gt; of \(T\).
In fact, we showed in &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2021-07-25-Boundaries-of-free-splittings.html&quot;&gt;July&lt;/a&gt; that \(\partial T\) is a Cantor set;
one might think of the points \(V_\infty(T)\) as being akin to the rational points
of the standard middle-thirds Cantor set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;laminations&quot;&gt;Laminations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the space&lt;/p&gt;

\[\tilde{\mathcal{B}}(T) = ((\partial T \times \partial T)\setminus \Delta )/ \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\]

&lt;p&gt;where \(\Delta\) is the diagonal and \(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\) acts by interchanging the coordinates.
Thus \(\tilde{\mathcal{B}}(T)\) is the space of unordered pairs of points
in the Bowditch boundary of \(T\).
The diagonal action of \(F\) on \(\partial T\) extends to an action on \(\tilde{\mathcal{B}}(T)\).
A &lt;em&gt;lamination&lt;/em&gt; is an \(F\)-invariant closed subset of \(\tilde{\mathcal{B}}(T)\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given a point \(\xi \in \partial_\infty T\), there is a lamination \(\Lambda(\xi)\)
called the &lt;em&gt;limit set&lt;/em&gt; of \(\xi\) defined as follows.
A point \((\alpha,\omega) \in \tilde{\mathcal{B}}(T)\) belongs to \(\Lambda(\xi)\)
if (possibly after swapping \(\alpha\) and \(\omega\)),
there is a sequence \(\{g_n\}\) of elements of \(F\)
such that the sequence \(\{g_n.p\}\) converges to \(\alpha\)
and the sequence \(\{g_n.\xi\}\) converges to \(\omega\).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Let \(F\) be a group.

I collaborate with other mathematicians on papers.
I’ve used Overleaf, emailing the paper back and forth,
and taking turns in Dropbox as my mode of collaboration.
I &lt;em&gt;haven’t&lt;/em&gt; collaborated using Git, but I sure would like to.
The purpose of this post is for mathematicians
like for example my younger self,
who are familiar with the command line
and curious about Git as a tool,
and for whatever reason don’t have the patience for something like “Git for Poets.”
I explain Git just enough to get you started on a simple project,
and hopefully enough so that you can start
Googling things you’re unfamiliar with.
I’m not an expert, and I expect my inexpertise to show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start. There are two ways I typically start.
The first way is 
that I have files on my computer that I would like to use Git on.
So I would open a command line,
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; over to where those files are (say &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/Documents/waver&lt;/code&gt;) and invoke
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git init&lt;/code&gt;.
This starts a new Git repository in the folder you’re in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other way is some Git repository already exists
(probably on GitHub)
and I would like to work on those files.
In that case I would find the URL of that repository,
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; to the directory where I would like to put my copy of the repository,
and invoke
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git clone &amp;lt;url&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
This automatically creates a new folder with the contents of the repository,
so if I was cloning &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ryleelyman/waver&lt;/code&gt; on GitHub, for instance,
and I wanted it to end up in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/Documents/waver&lt;/code&gt;,
I would run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git clone https://github.com/ryleelyman/waver.git&lt;/code&gt; 
in my &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/Documents&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Git is paying attention to the files in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/Documents/waver&lt;/code&gt;,
but by default it isn’t doing anything to them at all.
You can see what it thinks by invoking &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git status&lt;/code&gt;.
If you have files that have changed,
Git will display them (in red, in my terminal).
For example, when I run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git status&lt;/code&gt; in the
directory for my website, it tells me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Changes not staged for commit:
  (use &quot;git add &amp;lt;file&amp;gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
  (use &quot;git restore &amp;lt;file&amp;gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   _site/blog.html
        modified:   _site/feed.xml
        modified:   _site/sitemap.xml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Git tracks changes based on “commits,”
but in order for something to be committed
Git needs to know that you want to commit it.
That’s the business of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git add &amp;lt;file&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; comment above.
If we were to do &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git add _site/blog.html&lt;/code&gt;,
we would be telling Git to prepare to commit
the changes we made to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_site/blog.html&lt;/code&gt; file.
To actually commit the changes from there we would do
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git commit&lt;/code&gt;.
But! Don’t actually do &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git commit&lt;/code&gt;.
I prefer &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git commit -m &quot;&amp;lt;message&amp;gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.
Git commits require a little blurb from you about the changes,
and I find it much more convenient to just write that message
on the command line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Git knows about our changes locally.
If we’re working with a remote repository, say on GitHub,
we still need to update that repository.
To do that we invoke &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt;.
If you started the repository with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git init&lt;/code&gt;,
you may need to setup GitHub (or whatever it is)
to track the repository you created. 
GitHub has nice instructions for this.
To update our local repository with changes from the remote repository,
we would do &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are all the commands I use daily.
I didn’t talk about Gits “branching” model,
which is worth learning a bit about.
I don’t know that I have anything cogent to say about it,
so maybe I’ll stop here.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">As a mathematician, I collaborate with other mathematicians on papers.

hyperbolic metric space might still have locally compact Gromov boundary.
I was particularly interested in the case of a simplicial tree
equipped with the path metric where each edge has length \(1\)
with some vertices of infinite valence.
The answer in this case is &lt;em&gt;no.&lt;/em&gt;
Instead, the boundary of such a tree is homeomorphic to the &lt;em&gt;Baire space&lt;/em&gt; \(\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}\).
In this post I’ll talk through why this is the case.
There is also a notion of a &lt;em&gt;Bowditch boundary&lt;/em&gt; for a tree with vertices of infinite valence.
I’d like to show that the Bowditch boundary of such a tree is a Cantor set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trees we are interested in are Bass–Serre trees associated to free splittings of countable groups
with the property that some vertex group is infinite.
Let \(T\) be such a tree.
Then \(T\) admits a cocompact group action, has countably infinitely many edges
and has a vertex of countably infinite valence.
We can give \(T\) the structure of a metric space by considering the path metric
where each edge is assigned length \(1\).
The “identity map” from \(T\) as a simplicial complex to \(T\) as a metric space
is continuous, but its inverse is not.
The property that \(T\) admits a cocompact group action
implies that any geodesic ray (isometric embedding of \(\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}\))
passes through infinitely many vertices of infinite valence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-gromov-boundary-of-t&quot;&gt;The Gromov boundary of \(T\)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fix a point \(p\) in \(T\).
The Gromov boundary \(\partial_\infty T\) of \(T\) is the set of geodesic rays in \(T\) beginning at \(p\).
(It turns out that the Gromov boundary is independent of the choice of basepoint.)
Let \(J\) be a (finite) geodesic segment in \(T\) beginning at \(p\).
A basic open set \(U_J\) for the topology on \(\partial_\infty T\)
is given by the set of geodesic rays that contain \(J\) as a subpath.
I’ll leave it to show you that the intersection of basic open sets is either empty or another basic open set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-baire-space&quot;&gt;The Baire space&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Baire space \(\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}\) is homeomorphic to the irrational numbers.
A theorem of Alexandrov and Urysohn says that
the Baire space is characterized up to homeomorphism by the following properties.
It is a (nonempty) &lt;em&gt;Polish space,&lt;/em&gt; meaning it is &lt;em&gt;separable&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;completely metrizable.&lt;/em&gt;
It is &lt;em&gt;zero-dimensional,&lt;/em&gt; meaning it has a basis of clopen sets.
Finally, every compact subset has empty interior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To show that the Gromov boundary of \(T\) is homeomorphic to the Baire space,
we will verify these properties.
It is completely metrizable by general theory.
There are countably infinitely many finite geodesic segments in \(T\) beginning at \(p\)
(one for each vertex of \(T\)),
so \(\partial_\infty T\) is second countable, and in particular separable.
A basic closed set of \(\partial_\infty T\) is given by the set of those geodesic rays
that do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; contain a geodesic segment \(J\) as a subpath.
It’s not hard to find a collection of geodesic segments such that any geodesic ray
that does not contain any of these geodesic segments as a subpath must contain \(J\) as a subpath.
I’ll leave the details to you.
Therefore \(\partial_\infty T\) has a basis of clopen sets.
To show that every compact subset has empty interior,
it suffices to show that our basic clopen sets are never compact.
To see this, continue \(J\) until you reach a vertex of infinite valence,
giving us a new finite geodesic segment \(J&apos;\).
Write \(U_J \setminus U_{J&apos;}\) as a finite disjoint union of basic open sets,
and \(U_{J&apos;}\) as the infinite disjoint union of the \(U_{J&apos;&apos;}\),
where \(J&apos;&apos;\) is one edge longer than \(J&apos;\).
The result is an open cover of \(U_J\) with no finite subcover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bowditch-boundary&quot;&gt;The Bowditch boundary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Bowditch boundary&lt;/em&gt; of \(T\) is the set \(\partial T = \partial_\infty T \cup V_\infty(T)\),
where \(V_\infty(T)\) denotes the set of vertices of \(T\) with infinite valence.
The Bowditch boundary carries with it the &lt;em&gt;observer’s topology,&lt;/em&gt; which we now describe.
Given two points \(q\) and \(r\) in \(T\), the &lt;em&gt;direction of \(r\) at \(q\)&lt;/em&gt; is the component of \(T\setminus \{q\}\)
that contains \(r\).
We continue to think of points of \(\partial_\infty T\) as geodesic rays based at \(p\);
for convenience suppose that \(p\) is either in the interior of an edge or a vertex with finite valence.
We may additionally think of a point \(v \in V_\infty(T)\)
as being represented by the geodesic segment from \(p\) to \(v\).
We say that a point of \(\partial T\) belongs to a direction if the
corresponding geodesic starting at \(p\) is contained in the direction.
The set of directions in \(T\) forms a subbasis for the observer’s topology on \(\partial T\);
thus a basic open set is given by a finite intersection of directions of \(T\).
Put another way, a basic open set is given by the set of those geodesics based at \(p\)
that avoid a given finite subset of \(T\).
We can always take this finite set to be a set of vertices or midpoints of edges,
so the observer’s topology is second countable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d like to show that the Bowditch boundary of \(T\) is a Cantor set.
It is clear that \(\partial T\) has no isolated points.
It is compact and Hausdorff by general theory.
Thus it suffices to show that our basis elements are clopen.
We will show that our open basic open sets are compact.
Indeed, let \(U\) be a basic open set determined by the finite set of points \(\{z_1,\dotsc,z_n\} \subset T\),
and let \(\{U_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha\in I}\) be an open cover of \(U\) by basic open sets,
which are determined by finite sets of points containing \(\{z_1,\dotsc, z_n\}\) as a subset.
Take \(U_\alpha \in I\).
Then there are finitely many points \(z_{n+1},\dotsc,z_{n+k}\) determining \(U_\alpha\) and contained in \(U\).
For each \(z_{n+i}\) for \(i\) satisfying \(1 \le i \le k\), we can find \(\alpha_i \in I\)
such that \(U_{\alpha_i}\) contains \(z_{n+i}\).
Then \(U_\alpha,U_{\alpha_1},\dotsc,U_{\alpha_k}\) is a finite subcover of \(U\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-parallel-example&quot;&gt;A parallel example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the Cantor space be \(\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{N}}\).
The subspace of sequences which are eventually constant is countable and dense.
The subspace of sequences which are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; eventually constant is
&lt;a href=&quot;https://math.stackexchange.com/a/254381/447318&quot;&gt;homeomorphic to the Baire space&lt;/a&gt;.
This is more or less what is happening here: we add countably many points to
our non-locally compact Gromov boundary to get the compact Bowditch boundary.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The other day on Twitter I asked whether it might be the case that a non-proper hyperbolic metric space might still have locally compact Gromov boundary.

The word “proved” is in quotes because actually there was nothing to prove,
I just happened to be primed to notice that all the conditions were already there.
The purpose of this post is to tell you the story of how this came to be
and give the sketch of the proof that requires zero input from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the story.
The first full week of July,
I attended &lt;a href=&quot;https://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/~masmbe/Charney/&quot;&gt;Ruth Charney’s birthday conference&lt;/a&gt;.
It was wonderful to be around people doing math in person again!
At this conference, Mladen Bestvina gave a talk about the Farrell–Jones conjecture
for (virtually torsion-free) hyperbolic-by-cyclic groups.
I don’t fully understand the statement of the conjecture,
which says that certain assembly maps (?) in \(K\)-theory (??) or \(L\)-theory (???) are isomorphisms.
However, I did learn a useful tool for proving the Farrell–Jones conjecture,
a relatively recent (as in 2017) theorem due to Knopf:
if a (countable) group \(G\) acts acylindrically (without inversions) on a (simplicial) tree 
and the vertex stabilizers satisfy the Farrell–Jones conjecture, then so does \(G\).
Here &lt;em&gt;acylindrically&lt;/em&gt; means that there exists \(K \ge 0\) such that the stabilizer
of any geodesic segment of length \(K\) is finite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I worked on this past week after coming back was my first review for zbMath.
The paper I reviewed studied high-dimensional graph manifolds,
which were introduced by Figerio, Lafont and Sisto.
A high-dimensional graph manifold is made of &lt;em&gt;pieces,&lt;/em&gt;
each piece is a product of a torus and
a finite-volume hyperbolic manifold with toric cusps,
and the pieces are glued together by cutting off the cusps
into torus boundary components and gluing the tori.
As such, the fundamental group of a high-dimensional graph manifold is naturally
the fundamental group of a graph of groups
whose vertex groups are the pieces and whose edge groups are \(\mathbb{Z}^{n-1}\).
Figerio, Lafont and Sisto prove that the high-dimensional graph manifold is
what’s called &lt;em&gt;irreducible&lt;/em&gt; if and only if the action of the fundamental group
on the Bass–Serre tree for the graph of groups is acylindrical (in fact, you can take \(K\) to be \(3\)).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since CAT(0) groups (in particular, the fundamental groups of the pieces)
satisfy the Farrell–Jones conjecture,
the theorem above implies that irreducible high-dimensional graph manifold groups
satisfy the Farrell–Jones conjecture!
Not bad for no real work, eh?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The other day I “proved” the Farrell–Jones conjecture for a family of groups.
