a workshop where participants, myself included,
presented on papers about mapping class groups of infinite-type surfaces that we did not write.
I’d like to spend a couple of posts talking about the paper I was assigned,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10914&quot;&gt;Large scale geometry of big mapping class groups&lt;/a&gt;
by &lt;a href=&quot;https://e.math.cornell.edu/people/mann/&quot;&gt;Katie Mann&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.math.toronto.edu/~rafi/&quot;&gt;Kasra Rafi&lt;/a&gt;.
This is post “zero” in that series; 
I want to describe the project of large scale geometry of groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;groups-as-metric-spaces&quot;&gt;Groups as metric spaces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let’s begin.
Let \(G\) be a group,
and \(S\) a symmetric generating set.
Here, &lt;em&gt;symmetric&lt;/em&gt; means that if \(s\) belongs to \(S\), so does \(s^{-1}\).
Every element \(g\) of \(G\) can be written as&lt;/p&gt;

\[g = s_1 s_2 \ldots s_n\]

&lt;p&gt;where each \(s_i\) belongs to \(S\),
and we define the &lt;em&gt;word length&lt;/em&gt; \(||g||\) of \(g\) to be the minimal \(n\) possible.
By convention, the length of the identity element is zero.
This yields a &lt;em&gt;word metric&lt;/em&gt; on \(G\), where the distance \(d_S\) between \(g\) and \(h\) is&lt;/p&gt;

\[d_S(g,h) = ||g^{-1}h||.\]

&lt;p&gt;A good exercise is to prove that \(d_S\) &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a metric
(i.e. it’s symmetric, nonnegative, nonzero if \(g \ne h\), and satisfies the triangle inequality)
that is additionally &lt;em&gt;left invariant,&lt;/em&gt; in the sense that \(d_S(kg,kh) = d_S(g,h)\)
for all \(k \in G\).
Note: symmetry of \(d_S\) seems to require symmetry of \(S\).
If you relaxed the requirement of symmetry,
you might get “asymmetric” metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quasi-isometric-invariance&quot;&gt;Quasi-isometric invariance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, different choices of \(S\) yield &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; different metrics.
But! In some cases, some “large-scale” features of the metric are actually properties of the group,
in the sense that \(d_S\) and \(d_{S&apos;}\) are &lt;em&gt;quasi-isometric.&lt;/em&gt;
I defined quasi-isometry in &lt;a href=&quot;https://ryleealanza.org/2021/07/01/Gromov-hyperbolicity-for-arbitrary-metric-spaces.html&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;,
but the rough idea (as it were) is that distances are distorted a uniformly bounded amount
both multiplicatively and additively.
The classic example of this is the following lemma, due independently to Milnor and Schwarz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lemma.&lt;/strong&gt; Suppose a group \(G\) acts &lt;em&gt;properly discontinuously&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;cocompactly&lt;/em&gt;
by isometries on a geodesic metric space \((X,d)\).
Then \(G\) is finitely generated and \((X,d)\) is quasi-isometric
to \((G,d_S)\) for any finite, symmetric generating set \(S\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here &lt;em&gt;properly discontinuously&lt;/em&gt; means that for every compact subset \(K \subset X\),
the set of group elements \(g \in G\) such that \(g.K \cap K \ne \varnothing\) is finite.
(If you know what a &lt;em&gt;proper&lt;/em&gt; map of topological spaces is,
this is equivalent to the condition that the map \(G\times X \to X \times X\)
defined as \((g,x) \mapsto (g.x, x)\) is proper
when \(G\) is given the discrete topology.)
&lt;em&gt;Cocompact&lt;/em&gt; means the quotient \(G\backslash X\) is compact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, any properties of the metric space \((X,d)\) that are invariant under quasi-isometry
(and, crucially, there are many such)
are actually properties of the group \(G\)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A finitely generated group \(G\) is quasi-isometric to any of its finite-index subgroups,
so quasi-isometry is a somewhat weak relation.
Actually, saying the word “relation” just reminded me:
Carlos Adrian Perez Estrada pointed out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01353&quot;&gt;paper of Samuel Corson&lt;/a&gt; 
to me that proves that the symmetry of the quasi-isometry relation 
is equivalent to the axiom of choice,
which I think is quite a cute fact.
But anyway, a natural question to ask is when are two finitely generated groups quasi-isometric?
More ambitiously, we could follow a program of Gromov:
distinguish finitely generated groups up to quasi-isometry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-polish-generalization&quot;&gt;A Polish generalization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setting of the Mann–Rafi paper is mapping class groups of infinite-type surfaces,
so you should think surfaces with an infinite number of punctures 
(or more complicated “end” behavior)
or infinite genus.
Unlike the mapping class group of a finite-type surface,
these groups are &lt;em&gt;uncountable&lt;/em&gt; so certainly not finitely generated.
They come with two (equivalent) natural topologies:
Thinking of the mapping class group as a (continuous) quotient of the homeomorphism group
equipped with the compact–open topology yields one topology,
and the action of the mapping class group on the (countable) set of
isotopy classes of essential, simple closed curves on the surface
yields another called the &lt;em&gt;permutation topology.&lt;/em&gt;
Unfortunately, even with these topologies, things are not so nice: 
these are not locally compact groups.
Nevertheless they do have a useful structure:
they’re what are called &lt;em&gt;Polish groups,&lt;/em&gt; meaning 
they have a countable dense subset and admit a complete metric inducing the topology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~rosendal/&quot;&gt;Christian Rosendal&lt;/a&gt;
proposed a framework for large-scale geometry of Polish groups.
A subspace \(A\) of a Polish group \(G\) is called &lt;em&gt;coarsely bounded&lt;/em&gt;
if every &lt;em&gt;compatible&lt;/em&gt; (i.e.~inducing the topology) 
left-invariant metric \(d\) on \(G\) gives \(A\) finite &lt;em&gt;diameter,&lt;/em&gt;
in the sense that the supremum&lt;/p&gt;

\[\sup\{d(g,h) : g,\ h \in A\}\]

&lt;p&gt;is finite.
Equivalently, in every continuous action of \(G\) by isometries on a metric space \(X\),
the orbit \(A.x\) is bounded for every \(x \in X\).
So &lt;em&gt;bounded,&lt;/em&gt; yes, but also &lt;em&gt;coarsely&lt;/em&gt; because the metric may change but boundedness does not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usefulness of the concept is the following theorem,
which you might think of as a kind of “Milnor–Schwarz lemma” for Polish groups.
A group is &lt;em&gt;locally coarsely bounded&lt;/em&gt; if every element, or equivalently the identity,
has a coarsely bounded neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem&lt;/strong&gt; (Rosendal). If \(G\) is locally coarsely bounded,
then the map \(g \mapsto g\) is a quasi-isometry
from \((G,d_S)\) to \((G,d_{S&apos;})\) for any symmetric, &lt;em&gt;analytic,&lt;/em&gt; coarsely bounded generating sets
\(S\) and \(S&apos;\) for \(G\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;em&gt;analytic&lt;/em&gt; means the continuous image of another Polish space;
so for example any Borel subset will do.
Put another way, the theorem says that if a Polish group is both locally coarsely bounded
and generated by a coarsely bounded set,
then it has a well-defined quasi-isometry type.
One might ambitiously reframe Gromov’s program,
asking instead to classify such Polish groups up to quasi-isometry.
Mann–Rafi take the first steps towards this program 
for mapping class groups of infinite-type surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">A week ago I attended Big Mapping Class Groups at BC, a workshop where participants, myself included, presented on papers about mapping class groups of infinite-type surfaces that we did not write.

the Grothendieck construction might be one of the most surprisingly useful
techniques in basic category theory.
The purpose of this post is to introduce the Grothendieck construction
and illustrate a situation where it came up for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let \(\mathsf{C}\) be a category and \(F\colon \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{Cat}\)
a functor to the category of small categories.
The Grothendieck construction takes this situation
and produces a new category \(\mathsf{D}\) equipped with a functor 
\(\pi\colon \mathsf{D} \to \mathsf{C}\).
The category \(\mathsf{D}\) is sometimes called the &lt;em&gt;category of elements&lt;/em&gt; of the functor \(F\).
Now, \(F\) is allowed to be either covariant or contravariant,
but I’ll concentrate on the covariant case in this post.
If you wish, you may secretly replace \(\mathsf{Cat}\) with \(\mathsf{Set}\) or \(\mathsf{Grpoid}\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-category-of-elements&quot;&gt;The category of elements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the construction of the category \(\mathsf{D}\) assuming that \(F\) is covariant.
An object of \(\mathsf{D}\) is a pair \((c,x)\),
where \(c \in \mathsf{C}\) is an object and \(x \in Fc\) is an object.
(If \(\mathsf{Cat}\) were \(\mathsf{Set}\), we’d have an &lt;em&gt;element&lt;/em&gt; of the set \(Fc\), hence the name.)
An arrow \((c,x) \to (d,y)\) is a pair \((f,\alpha)\),
where \(f\colon c \to d\) is an arrow in \(\mathsf{C}\) 
and \(\alpha\colon Ff(x) \to y\) is an arrow in the category \(Fd\).
(If \(\mathsf{Cat}\) is \(\mathsf{Set}\), the only arrows are of the form \((f,1_{Ff(x)})\)
from \((c,x)\) to \((d,Ff(x))\).)
If you think about it, the only sensible way to define
the composition of \((f,\alpha)\colon (c,x) \to (d,y)\) with \((g,\beta)\colon (d,y) \to (e,z)\)
is as \((gf,\beta \circ Fg(\alpha))\),
and so we do. 
Checking that composition is associative is cute; I’ll let you do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The functor \(\pi\colon \mathsf{D} \to \mathsf{C}\) is sort of staring at us:
it’s defined as \(\pi(c,x) = c\) and \(\pi(f,\alpha) = f\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;co-fibered-categories&quot;&gt;Co-fibered categories&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The functor \(\pi\colon \mathsf{D} \to \mathsf{C}\) is &lt;em&gt;pre-cofibered&lt;/em&gt;
in the sense that given \(f\colon c \to d\) in \(\mathsf{C}\)
and any object of the form \((c,x)\),
precomposition with the arrow \((f,1_{Ff(x)})\) provides,
for any \((d,y)\) in \(\mathsf{D}\),
an isomorphism&lt;/p&gt;

\[\{(1_d,\alpha) \colon (d,Ff(x)) \to (d,y)\} \cong \{(f,\beta) \colon (x,c) \to (d,y)\}.\]

&lt;p&gt;The arrows of the form \((f,1_x)\) are called &lt;em&gt;co-cartesian&lt;/em&gt;
and because the composition of co-cartesian arrows is co-cartesian,
we say that \(\pi\colon \mathsf{D} \to \mathsf{C}\) is &lt;em&gt;cofibered.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usefulness of this formulation is the following
corollary to Quillen’s Theorem A:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corollary.&lt;/strong&gt; Suppose that \(\pi\colon \mathsf{D} \to \mathsf{C}\)
 is pre-cofibered (or the dual notion, &lt;em&gt;pre-fibered&lt;/em&gt;)
 and that for each \(c \in \mathsf{C}\),
 the category \(\pi^{-1}(c)\) comprising those objects \(d \in \mathsf{D}\)
 satisfying \(\pi(d) = c\) and those arrows \(\alpha\) satisfying \(\pi(\alpha) = 1_c\)
 has a contractible geometric realization.
 Then the resulting map of geometric realizations \(|\pi|\colon |\mathsf{D}| \to |\mathsf{C}|\)
 is a homotopy equivalence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how this came up for me:
I have managed to be very coy about talking about Outer Space so far
and unfortunately I will continue to be coy here and now.
The &lt;em&gt;spine of Outer Space&lt;/em&gt; is the geometric realization of a certain category,
whose objects are in one formulation (equivalence classes) of trees
equipped with the action of a group (classically the free group of rank \(n\))
satisfying certain conditions.
Arrows of the category are collapse maps.
If we think of the barycentric subdivision of each tree as a geometric realization of a category,
then each collapse map is a &lt;em&gt;functor&lt;/em&gt; of the associated categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carefully (or not, the equivalence relation is such that the “category of choices”
is a contractible groupoid)
choosing a tree in each equivalence class defines, then,
a &lt;em&gt;functor&lt;/em&gt; from Outer Space to \(\mathsf{Cat}\).
If you perform the Grothendieck construction on this situation,
you get &lt;em&gt;the spine of l’Autre Espace&lt;/em&gt; (French: “the other space”),
a space that the full &lt;em&gt;automorphism&lt;/em&gt; group of a free group acts on nicely.
Anyway, contractibility of the spine of l’Autre Espace 
thus follows from the fact that trees are contractible,
the spine of Outer Space is contractible, and the corollary to Quillen’s Theorem A.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I think that right after you learn the Yoneda lemma, the Grothendieck construction might be one of the most surprisingly useful techniques in basic category theory.

Let’s do that now,
and introduce &lt;em&gt;compactly generated&lt;/em&gt; topological spaces in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;adjoint-functors&quot;&gt;Adjoint functors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pair of functors \(F\colon \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{D}\) and \(G\colon \mathsf{D} \to \mathsf{C}\) 
are an &lt;em&gt;adjoint pair,&lt;/em&gt;
or more accurately, \(F\) is &lt;em&gt;left adjoint&lt;/em&gt; to \(G\)
and \(G\) is &lt;em&gt;right adjoint&lt;/em&gt; to \(F\), written \(F \dashv G\),
if there is an isomorphism&lt;/p&gt;

\[\mathsf{D}(Fc,d) \cong \mathsf{C}(c,Gd)\]

&lt;p&gt;natural in \(c\) and \(d\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, let \(\mathsf{C}\) be the category of sets \(\mathsf{Set}\)
and \(\mathsf{D}\) the category of groups \(\mathsf{Grp}\).
Since every group is in particular a set,
and every homomorphism in particular a function,
we have a functor \(U\colon \mathsf{Grp} \to \mathsf{Set}\).
On the other side we have a functor \(F\colon \mathsf{Set} \to \mathsf{Grp}\)
that sends a set \(X\) to the free group on that set \(F(X)\).
The claimed isomorphism&lt;/p&gt;

\[\mathsf{Grp}(FX,G) \cong \mathsf{Set}(X,UG)\]

&lt;p&gt;says that homomorphisms from the free group on a set \(X\) to a group \(G\)
are in one-to-one correspondence with set maps from \(X\) to the set \(G\).
This is the universal property of the free group!
I can imagine it being a good idea to trace out what naturality is asserting here;
you should try it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example is \(\iota \dashv (\cdot)^{\operatorname{ab}}\),
where \(\iota\colon \mathsf{Ab} \to \mathsf{Grp}\) is the inclusion
of the category of abelian groups into the category of groups
and \((\cdot)^{\operatorname{ab}}\colon \mathsf{Grp} \to \mathsf{Ab}\)
sends a group to its &lt;em&gt;abelianization.&lt;/em&gt;
Here the claimed isomorphism&lt;/p&gt;

\[\mathsf{Ab}(G^{\operatorname{ab}},A) \cong \mathsf{Grp}(G,\iota A)\]

&lt;p&gt;says that homomorphisms from the abelianization of \(G\) to an abelian group \(A\)
are in one-to-one correspondence with homomorphisms from \(G\) to \(A\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be particularly illuminating to plug the same object 
into one side of the equation and see what happens to the identity on the other side.
A silly example is if we let \(G = \iota A\).
On the lefthand side of the equation we have for every abelian group \(A\)
a special homomorphism \(\epsilon_A \colon (\iota A)^{\operatorname{ab}} \to A\);
this turns out to be the isomorphism identifying the abelianization of an abelian group \(A\) with itself.
This homomorphism, if you trace it out,
turns out to be natural in \(A\); we call it the &lt;em&gt;counit&lt;/em&gt; of the adjunction.
A less silly example is if we let \(A = G^{\operatorname{ab}}\).
Then on the righthand side of the equation we have for every group \(G\)
a special homomorphism \(\eta_G \colon G \to \iota(G^{\operatorname{ab}})\).
This is the homomorphism from \(G\) to its abelianization;
it turns out to be natural in \(G\) and we call it the &lt;em&gt;unit&lt;/em&gt; of the adjunction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our free group example, the unit sends a set \(X\) to its image inside \(FX\)
and the counit is the map from the free group on the underlying set of a group \(G\)
to the group \(G\) that takes a word generated by elements of the group \(G\) and evaluates 
it as an element of the group \(G\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zooming out, if we return to the general setting \(F \dashv G\),
we always have \(\eta\colon 1_{\mathsf{C}} \Rightarrow GF\)
and \(\epsilon\colon FG \Rightarrow 1_{\mathsf{D}}\),
and it turns out these natural transformations satisfy the following two identities
called the &lt;em&gt;triangle identities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

\[(\epsilon F) \cdot (F\eta) = 1_{F}\quad\text{and}\quad (G\epsilon)\cdot (\eta G) = 1_{G}.\]

&lt;p&gt;For the free \(\dashv\) forgetful adjunction,
the first identity says that if you take the map \(FX \to FUFX\) defined 
on sets by sending \(X\) to its image in \(UFX\) and then extending to the free groups on these sets,
and then follow it with the map \(FUFX \to FX\) that recognizes a word in \(UFX\) as an element of \(FX\),
you get the identity of the free group on \(X\), which seems believable.
The second identity says that if you start with a group \(G\),
the map \(UG \to UFUG\) that sends an element \(g \in G\) to that element thought of as a word in \(FUG\),
and then apply the map \(UFUG \to UG\) that is the underlying set map of the homomorphism \(FUG \to G\)
that recognizes a word in \(G\) as an element of \(G\), you get the identity of \(UG\),
also believable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it turns out that for a pair of functors \(F\colon \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{D}\)
and \(G\colon \mathsf{D} \to \mathsf{C}\),
the existence of the natural transformations \(\eta\colon 1_{\mathsf{C}} \Rightarrow GF\)
and \(\epsilon\colon FG \Rightarrow 1_{\mathsf{D}}\) satisfying the triangle identities
is equivalent to having an adjunction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflective-and-coreflective-subcategories&quot;&gt;Reflective and coreflective subcategories&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example of abelianization is an example of something the nLab delightfully called &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/completion&quot;&gt;-ification&lt;/a&gt;,
or did back in 2019.
The idea is we have a full subcategory \(\mathsf{Ab}\) of \(\mathsf{Grp}\)
(every homomorphism of abelian groups qua groups is a homomorphism of abelian groups)
and the inclusion \(\iota\) has a left adjoint.
The unit of the adjunction is a morphism in the larger category from an object to its “reflection” 
in the smaller category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dual notion, when the inclusion has a &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; adjoint,
is a &lt;em&gt;coreflective&lt;/em&gt; subcategory.
An example of this, that I’d like to explain partially for myself,
is the inclusion of compactly generated spaces into all spaces.
A Hausdorff space \(Y\) is &lt;em&gt;compactly generated,&lt;/em&gt; in one formulation,
if it is the direct limit (or colimit, if you prefer) of all of its compact subspaces.
By the definition of the direct limit,
this says that a map \(Y \to X\) is continuous if and only if 
its restriction to every compact (necessarily Hausdorff) subspace is continuous.
Since the image of a compact Hausdorff space \(K\) in \(Y\) is compact Hausdorff,
this is equivalent to saying the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A map \(Y \to X\) is continuous if and only if
for every map from a compact Hausdorff space \(K\) to \(Y\),
the composition \(K \to Y \to X\) is continuous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This latter statement is more appropriately the defintion of a compactly generated space if we don’t assume
\(Y\) to be Hausdorff.
We will, though, because I like Hausdorff spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The category \(\mathsf{CGHaus}\) is a full subcategory of \(\mathsf{Haus}\),
the category of Hausdorff topological spaces and continuous functions.
In fact it is a coreflective subcategory:
the right adjoint of the inclusion \(\iota\) is the functor \(k\) which sends a space \(X\)
to \(kX\), the direct limit of all of its compact subspaces.
Let’s check that this is really a functor:
given a map \(f\colon X \to Y\),
the restriction of \(f\) to any subspace is continuous,
and the image of a compact subset of \(X\) is a compact subset of \(Y\),
so the restrictions \(f|_K\) assemble into a map \(kf\colon kX \to kY\).
It’s not hard to check that this construction respects function composition
and sends the identity of \(X\) to the identity of \(kX\).
So we have \(\iota\colon \mathsf{CGHaus} \to \mathsf{Haus}\) and \(k\colon\mathsf{Haus} \to \mathsf{CGHaus}\).
The adjunction is the claim that we have&lt;/p&gt;

\[\mathsf{Haus}(\iota X,Y) \cong \mathsf{CGHaus}(X,kY).\]

&lt;p&gt;In other words, there is a (natural) bijection between maps 
from a compactly generated Hausdorff space \(X\) to a Hausdorff space \(Y\)
and maps from \(X\) to \(kY\).
This is true: 
given a map \(f\colon X \to Y\) and a compact subset \(K\) of \(X\),
the restriction \(f|_K\) has image a compact subspace of \(Y\),
which we may continue into \(kY\).
These maps glue up to give a map from the direct limit of all compact subspaces of \(X\) to \(kY\).
Since \(X\) is compactly generated Hausdorff,
it is the direct limit of its compact subsets,
so what we have shown is that the map \(f\) &lt;em&gt;factors through&lt;/em&gt; the map \(\epsilon_Y\colon kY \to Y\)
defined by the universal property of the direct limit.
It is clear that this process is surjective,
and it is injective as well: if \(f \ne g\), since \(X\) is the direct limit of all of its compact subsets,
we can find a compact subspace on which \(f\) and \(g\) disagree,
so their images in \(kY\) disagree, so the maps \(\tilde f \colon X \to kY\) and \(\tilde g\colon X \to kY\)
disagree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to finish out this blog post with one of the coolest applications of adjoint functors:
“Right Adjoints Preserve Limits” and dually “Left Adjoints Preserve Colimits”.
What this says, supposing I have an adjoint pair \(F \dashv G\)
between \(\mathsf{C}\) and \(\mathsf{D}\),
is that \(\varprojlim_i Gd_i = G(\varprojlim_i d_i)\)
and \(\varinjlim_i Fc_i = F(\varinjlim_i c_i)\).
So if I have a diagram whose limit I want to compute in \(\mathsf{C}\) which comes from \(\mathsf{D}\)
via \(G\),
I can compute its limit in \(\mathsf{D}\) and then apply \(G\), and I’ll get what I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s bring it down to earth.
One thing this says is that the free product of two free groups \(FX\) and \(FY\)
is the free group on their disjoint union \(FX * FY = F(X\amalg Y)\).
Another thing this says is that the underlying set of the product of two groups \(G\) and \(H\)
is the product of \(G\) and \(H\) as sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For compactly generated Hausdorff spaces,
this says that the product of \(kX\) and \(kY\) is \(k(X\times Y)\),
but that (for instance) their disjoint union is already compactly generated Hausdorff.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I realized I haven’t, to my knowledge, talked about adjoint functors yet!

you can treat them almost as if they were spaces
in the sense that, as you’ll see, objects of a stack \(\mathsf{D}\) over a space \(Y\)
are the same thing as maps of stacks \(Y \to \mathsf{D}\),
just like the situation of \(\underline{X}\) for a space \(X\).
The difference is that \(\mathsf{D}\) may have many isomorphisms &lt;em&gt;stacked&lt;/em&gt; over 
\(Y \to \mathsf{D}\)
while \(\underline{X}\) has only the identity of \(Y\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In what might be the final post on stacks for a while,
I’d like to show that every topological stack is isomorphic to
\(\mathsf{B}\mathcal{G}\) for some topological groupoid \(\mathcal{G}\).
We could then say that, for instance, a graph of groups
is any stack isomorphic to \(\mathsf{B}\mathcal{G}\),
where \(\mathcal{G}\) is the étale groupoid we constructed &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/05/14/Graphs-of-groups-as-%C3%A9tale-groupoids.html&quot;&gt;in a previous post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose \(\mathsf{D}\) is a topological stack
with an atlas \(p\colon X \to \mathsf{D}\).
We claim that \(X \times_{\mathsf{D}} X\) 
(which is a space since \(X\) is an atlas)
is a space of arrows for a groupoid \(\mathcal{G}\) with space of objects \(X\).
That finished,
we will construct an isomorphism \(\psi\colon \mathsf{D} \to \mathsf{B}\mathcal{G}\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus we are in search of structure maps for our groupoid.
By the 2-Yoneda lemma, 
if \(X\) and \(Y\) are spaces, any map of stacks \(X \to Y\)
is determined up to natural isomorphism by an object of \(\underline{Y}\) over \(X\);
in other words, a continuous map \(f\colon X \to Y\).
But because the fiber of \(\underline{Y}\) comprises only the identity arrow,
this map \(f\) is in fact unique.
Therefore, it suffices to produce maps of stacks for our structure maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We take source and target maps of \(\mathcal{G}\) to be the two projections
from \(X\times_{\mathsf{D}} X\) to \(X\).
In more words, \((x,y,f) \mapsto X\) and \((x,y,f) \mapsto Y\).
Note that the diagram&lt;/p&gt;

\[\require{AMScd}\begin{CD}
X @&amp;gt;1_X&amp;gt;&amp;gt; X \\
@VV1_XV @VVpV \\
X @&amp;gt;p&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \mathsf{D}
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;commutes (on the nose),
so there is a map \(X \to X\times_{\mathsf{D}} X\).
If you chase through the definition of maps to the 2-fiber product,
you see that on objects the map is \(Y \mapsto (Y,Y,1_Y)\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The multiplication map&lt;/p&gt;

\[m\colon (X\times_{\mathsf{D}}X)\times_X(X\times_{\mathsf{D}}X) \to X \times_{\mathsf{D}} X\]

&lt;p&gt;is defined on objects as \(((x,y,f),(y,z,g) = (x,z,gf)\).
This multiplication is associative because composition of arrows in \(\mathsf{D}\) is associative.
The inversion map \((\cdot)^{-1}\) is given on objects as&lt;/p&gt;

\[(x,y,f)^{-1} = (y,x,f^{-1}).\]

&lt;p&gt;So far we have not used any of the stack properties, 
merely that the category is fibered in groupoids.
(I cannot help myself: if the category were merely fibered in categories, 
whatever that might mean, we would end up with a category which is not a groupoid.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we define \(\psi\colon \mathsf{D} \to \mathsf{B}\mathcal{G}\).
This means that to each object of \(\mathsf{D}\) over a space \(Y\),
we need to produce a principal \(\mathcal{G}\)-bundle over \(Y\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall that by the 2-Yoneda lemma an object of \(\mathsf{D}\) over \(Y\)
is the same thing as a map of stacks \(f\colon Y \to \mathsf{D}\).
Since \(X\) is an atlas, the fiber product \(Y \times_{\mathsf{D}} X\) is a space
and the map \(Y\times_{\mathsf{D}} X \to Y\) is an open surjection which admits local sections.
We let the projection \(Y\times_{\mathsf{D}} X \to X\) be the anchor map
for the right action of \(\mathcal{G}\) defined on objects as&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{gather*}
(Y\times_{\mathsf{D}} X)\times_X(X\times_{\mathsf{D}}X) \to Y \times_{\mathsf{D}} X \\
((y,x_2,f),(x_1,x_2,g)) \mapsto (y,x_1,g^{-1}f).
\end{gather*}\]

&lt;p&gt;(This disagrees with &lt;a href=&quot;https://ems.press/content/serial-article-files/6839&quot;&gt;Lerman&lt;/a&gt; but is the correct definition for a &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; action.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The map&lt;/p&gt;

\[(Y\times_{\mathsf{D}}X)\times_X\mathcal{G}_1 
\to (Y\times_{\mathsf{D}}X)\times_Y(Y\times_{\mathsf{D}}X)\]

&lt;p&gt;defined by&lt;/p&gt;

\[((y,x_2,f),(x_1,x_2,g)) \mapsto ((y,x_2,f),(y,x_1,g^{-1}f))\]

&lt;p&gt;is clearly (the action on objects of) an isomorphism of stacks,
so the action of \(\mathcal{G}\) on \((Y\times_{\mathsf{D}}X)\) is free and transitive.
Thus we define \(\psi(f\colon M \to \mathsf{D})\) to be the principal \(\mathcal{G}\)-bundle
\(Y \times_{\mathsf{D}}X \to Y\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if an object of \(\mathsf{D}\) over a space \(Y\) is a map \(f\colon Y \to \mathsf{D}\)
and an object of \(\mathsf{D}\) over a space \(Z\) is a map \(g \colon Z \to \mathsf{D}\),
then an arrow of \(\mathsf{D}\) over the map \(h \colon Y \to Z\)
should in fact be the map \(h \colon Y \to Z\) making the diagram&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
Y @&amp;gt;f&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \mathsf{D} \\
@VVhV @| \\
Z @&amp;gt;g&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \mathsf{D}
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;commute—at least, up to a specified natural isomorphism \(\eta\colon f \Rightarrow gh\).
I think this is a missing naturality statement in the 2-Yoneda lemma,
so expect an appendix.
If we believe that for now, let’s continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now notice that we get a commutative diagram&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
Y \times_{\mathsf{D}} X @&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; X \\
@VVh\pi V @VVpV \\
Z @&amp;gt;g&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \mathsf{D}
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;up to the composite natural transformation \(\epsilon\eta\)
(where \(\epsilon\) is the defining natural transformation for the fiber product
\(Y\times_{\mathsf{D}} X\)).
Therefore by the universal property of the 2-fiber product,
we get a map \(\tilde h\colon Y\times_{\mathsf{D}}X \to Z\times_{\mathsf{D}}X\)
such that the following diagram commutes&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
Y\times_{\mathsf{D}}X @&amp;gt;\tilde h&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Z\times_{\mathsf{D}}X \\
@VV\pi V @VV\pi V \\
Y @&amp;gt;h&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Z
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;up to a natural isomorphism, which must be the identity,
because every object in the diagram is a space.
Specifically, chasing through the map as described when we considered 2-fiber products,
on objects we have
\(\tilde h(y,x,f) = (h(y),x,f)\).
It is clear from this definition that \(\tilde h\) is \(\mathcal{G}\)-equivariant,
and that \(\psi\) is functorial and fully faithful.
We still haven’t used that \(\mathsf{D}\) is a stack!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To complete the proof, we need to show that \(\psi\) is essentially surjective.
First, we show it for \(\mathcal{G}\)-bundles with a global section.
By an argument I think I failed to give—if so, sorry—such a bundle
is (canonically isomorphic to) 
the pullback bundle \(f^*\mathcal{G}_1\) by a map \(f\colon Y \to X\).
Now, given such a map \(f\colon Y \to X\),
notice that the silly diagram&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
Y @&amp;gt;pf&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \mathsf{D} \\
@VVfV @| \\
X @&amp;gt;p&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \mathsf{D}
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;commutes on the nose, so certainly up to natural transformation.
The bundle \(\psi(pf)\) is \(Y\times_{\mathsf{D}}X\) over \(Y\),
which has an equivariant map \(\psi(f)\) to \(\mathcal{G}_1\)
and hence an isomorphism \(Y\times_{\mathsf{D}}X \cong f^*\mathcal{G}_1\).
Therefore \(Y\times_{\mathsf{D}}X\) has a global section \(\sigma\)
with the property, if you chase it through,
that \(\pi_2\sigma \colon Y\times_{\mathsf{D}}X \to X\) is \(k\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if we have a commuting diagram of spaces&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
Y @&amp;gt;f&amp;gt;&amp;gt; X \\
@VVhV @| \\
Z @&amp;gt;g&amp;gt;&amp;gt; X
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;then composing with \(p\colon X \to \mathsf{D}\) yields a commuting map of stacks,
i.e. a map between the bundles \(\psi(f)\) and \(\psi(g)\).
This map is (isomorphic to) \(\tilde h\colon f^*\mathcal{G}_1 \to g^*\mathcal{G}_1\).
Therefore the full subcategory of \(\mathsf{B}\mathcal{G}\)
spanned by the bundles which have global sections is in the image of \(\psi\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now suppose \(E\) is a principal \(\mathcal{G}\)-bundle over a space \(Y\).
Then \(Y\) has an open cover \(\mathcal{U} = \{U_i\}_{i\in I}\)
with the property that each \(\iota_i^*E\) has a global section.
The pullbacks of intersections define a descent datum for this open cover,
which lives in the image of \(\psi\).
Thus since \(\mathsf{D}\) is a stack, the descent datum is effective,
giving us an element \(\xi\) of \(\mathsf{D}\).
By functoriality of \(\mathsf{D}\) and since isomorphisms form a sheaf,
we conclude that \(\psi(\xi)\) is isomorphic to \(E\),
showing that \(\psi\) is essentially surjective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us remark that atlases are super not unique,
but that if we have two atlases \(p\colon X \to \mathsf{D}\) and \(q\colon Y \to \mathsf{D}\)
we can construct a bibundle \(P = X\times_{\mathsf{D}} Y\)
which is principal for both resulting groupoids.
Therefore the bibundle is invertible.
Put another way, the groupoids are equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">In writing this post, I started to see what’s kind of cool about stacks: you can treat them almost as if they were spaces in the sense that, as you’ll see, objects of a stack \(\mathsf{D}\) over a space \(Y\) are the same thing as maps of stacks \(Y \to \mathsf{D}\), just like the situation of \(\underline{X}\) for a space \(X\).

&lt;h2 id=&quot;atlases&quot;&gt;Atlases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will say that a stack over \(\mathbf{Top}\) “is a space” if it is isomorphic as a stack
to \(\underline{X}\) for some topological space \(X\).
Following Lerman, we will in fact just drop the underline,
thinking of \(X\) as the stack \(\underline{X}\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;em&gt;atlas&lt;/em&gt; for a stack \(\mathsf{D}\) is a space \(X\)
and a map \(p\colon X \to \mathsf{D}\)
such that for any map \(f\colon Y \to \mathsf{D}\) of a space into \(\mathsf{D}\),
the fiber product \(Y \times_{\mathsf{D}} X\) is a space
and the map \(\pi_1 \colon Y \times_{\mathsf{D}} X \to Y\)
is an open surjection which admits local sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently it is common to say in the literature 
that the map \(X \to \mathsf{D}\) is &lt;em&gt;representable.&lt;/em&gt;
We say that \(\mathsf{D}\) is a &lt;em&gt;topological stack&lt;/em&gt; if it has an atlas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;example-mathsfbmathcalg&quot;&gt;Example: \(\mathsf{B}\mathcal{G}\)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let \(\mathcal{G}\) be a topological groupoid,
and let \(\mathsf{B}\mathcal{G}\) be the category of principal \(\mathcal{G}\)-bundles
and \(\mathcal{G}\)-equivariant maps.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://ems.press/content/serial-article-files/6839&quot;&gt;Lerman&lt;/a&gt; shows that \(\mathsf{B}\mathcal{G}\) is fibered in groupoids over \(\mathbf{Top}\);
well, strictly speaking he is talking about Lie groupoids, but the argument works just fine
for spaces and topological groupoids.
In fact it is a stack: just as, you might think,
given a topological group \(G\) and a principal \(G\)-bundle on an open cover of a space \(X\)
with gluing data, you can glue up to form a principal \(G\)-bundle on \(X\),
you can do the same for groupoids,
and moreover isomorphisms form a sheaf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given a topological groupoid \(\mathcal{G}\),
we claim that the map \(p\colon \mathcal{G}_0 \to \mathsf{B}\mathcal{G}\)
defined (by the 2-Yoneda lemma) by 
the principal \(\mathcal{G}\)-bundle \(\omega\colon \mathcal{G}_1 \to \mathcal{G}_0\)
is an atlas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So given any space \(Y\) and a map \(E\colon Y \to \mathsf{B}\mathcal{G}\), 
we need to show that \(Y\times_{\mathsf{B}\mathcal{G}} \mathcal{G}_0\)
is a space.
First, note that by the 2-Yoneda lemma,
the functor \(E\) is determined by a principal \(\mathcal{G}\)-bundle \(E \to Y\).
Given a map \(g\colon Z \to Y\), the bundle \(E(g)\) is canonically isomorphic
to the pullback \(g^*E\), so to ease notation, we will assume 
that it is actually equal to \(g^*E\).
Similarly given \(f\colon Z \to \mathcal{G}_0\), we will assume
the bundle \(p(f)\) is \(f^*\mathcal{G}_1\).
Thus an object of the fiber product over a space \(Z\) is a triple
\((g,f,\beta)\)
where \(g\colon Z \to Y\) and \(f\colon Z \to \mathcal{G}_0\) are maps of spaces
and \(\beta\colon g^*E \to f^*\mathcal{G}_1\) is a \(\mathcal{G}\)-equivariant map of bundles,
hence an isomorphism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall that&lt;/p&gt;

\[f^*\mathcal{G}_1 = \{(z,h) \in Z \times \mathcal{G}_1 : f(z) = \omega(h) \}.\]

&lt;p&gt;The map \(z \mapsto (z,1_{f(z)})\) defines a global section \(\sigma\) of this bundle.
We claim that the isomorphism \(\beta^{-1}\colon f^*\mathcal{G}_1 \to g^*E\)
is determined uniquely by the image of \(\sigma\).
Indeed, given \(\beta^{-1}(\sigma(z)) = (z,e)\),
we must have \(\beta^{-1}(z,h) = \beta^{-1}(\sigma(z).h) = (z,e).h\),
for all appropriate \(h \in \mathcal{G}_1\),
so fiber by fiber the bundle map \(\beta^{-1}\) 
is determined by the point \(\beta^{-1}(\sigma(z))\).
This gives us a map \(\tau\colon Z \to E\) 
defined as \(z \mapsto e\) such that \(\pi \tau = g\),
where \(\pi\colon E \to Y\) is the defining map of the principal bundle \(E\).
Notice that the anchor map of, for instance, \(g^*E\) is
\((z,e) \mapsto a(e)\), where \(a \colon E \to \mathcal{G}_0\) is the anchor map.
We have&lt;/p&gt;

\[f = f\pi\sigma = \omega f_{\mathcal{G}_1} \sigma 
= \alpha (\cdot)^{-1} f_{\mathcal{G}_1} \sigma = \alpha f_{\mathcal{G}_1}\sigma,\]

&lt;p&gt;since \(\sigma(z) = (z,1_{f(z)})\). But then&lt;/p&gt;

\[\alpha f_{\mathcal{G}_1\sigma} = a g_E \beta^{-1} \sigma,\]

&lt;p&gt;since the isomorphism \(\beta\) intertwines the actions and thus preserves anchor maps.
Finally,&lt;/p&gt;

\[a g_E \beta^{-1} \sigma = a \tau.\]

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, given any map \(\tau \colon Z \to E\), 
we reconstruct \((g,f,\beta)\) as follows: the map \(g \colon Z \to Y\) is \(\pi\tau\),
the map \(f\) is \(a\tau\),
Finally we need a map \(\beta \colon g^*E \to f^*\mathcal{G}_1\).
By definition we have&lt;/p&gt;

\[g^*E = \{(z,e) \in Z\times E : \pi\tau(z) = \pi(e) \} \quad\text{and}\quad
f^*\mathcal{G}_1 = \{(z,h) \in Z \times \mathcal{G}_1 : a\tau(z) = \omega(h) \}.\]

&lt;p&gt;Define \(\beta(z,\tau(z)) = (z,1_{a\tau(z)})\) and extend equivariantly.
It is clear that these constructions are mutually inverse,
and we conclude that objects of the 2-fiber product are (isomorphic to) maps of spaces to \(E\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for arrows! Suppose we have an arrow \((u,v)\colon (g_1,f_1,\beta_1) \to (g_2,f_2,\beta_2)\)
over a map of spaces \(h\colon Z_1 \to Z_2\).
This is a pair of maps \(u\colon Z_1 \to Z_2\) and \(v\colon Z_1 \to Z_2\)
with the property that the following diagrams commute&lt;/p&gt;

\[\require{AMScd}\begin{CD}
Z_1 @&amp;gt;g_1&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Y \\
@VVuV @| \\
Z_2 @&amp;gt;g_2&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Y
\end{CD}\qquad\begin{CD}
Z_1 @&amp;gt;f_1&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \mathcal{G}_0 \\
@VVvV @| \\
Z_2 @&amp;gt;f_2&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \mathcal{G}_0
\end{CD}\qquad \begin{CD}
g_1^*E @&amp;gt;\beta_1&amp;gt;&amp;gt; f_1^*\mathcal{G}_1 \\
@VV\tilde uV @VV\tilde vV \\
g_2^*E @&amp;gt;\beta_2&amp;gt;&amp;gt; f_2^*\mathcal{G}_1,
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;where \(\tilde u\) and \(\tilde v\) are the unique \(\mathcal{G}\)-equivariant maps
satisfying \((g_1)_E = (g_2)_E \tilde u\) 
and \((f_1)_{\mathcal{G}_1} = (f_2)_{\mathcal{G}_1}\tilde v\).
But because each \(\beta_i\) is over the identity map of \(Z_i\),
we conclude that in fact \(u = v\).
We have&lt;/p&gt;

\[\tau_1\pi_1 = (g_1)_E \beta_1^{-1} = (g_2)_E \tilde u \beta_1^{-1}
= (g_2)_E \beta_2^{-1}\tilde v = \tau_2\pi_2 \tilde v = \tau_2 u \pi_1,\]

&lt;p&gt;so because \(\pi_1\) is an epimorphism, we conclude \(\tau_1 = \tau_2 u\).
Finally, because, for instance, \((g_1)_E(z,\tau_1(z).h) = \tau_1(z).h\)
and \((g_2)_E(z,\tau_2(z).h) = \tau_2(z).h\),
we must have \(\tilde u(z,\tau_1(z).h) = (u(z),\tau_2u(z)) = (u(z),\tau_1(z))\)
and similarly \(\tilde v(z,1_{a\tau_1(z)}) = (v(z),1_{a\tau_2(u(z))}) = (v(z),1_{a\tau_1(z)})\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, given \(u \colon Z_1 \to Z_2\) such that \(\tau_1 = \tau_2u\),
observe that \(g_1 = \pi\tau_1 = \pi\tau_2 u = g_2u\)
and \(f_2 = a\tau_1 = a\tau_2 u = f_2u\).
We have, for any \(z \in Z_1\) and appropriate \(h \in \mathcal{G}_1\),&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{gather*}
\tilde v \beta_1(z,\tau_1(z).h) = \tilde v(z,h) = (v(z),h)  = (u(z),h) \\
= \beta_2(u(z),\tau_2u(z).h) = \beta_2(u(z),\tau_1(z).h) = \beta_2\tilde u(z,\tau_1(z).h).
\end{gather*}\]

&lt;p&gt;Therefore arrows in the 2-fiber product are (isomorphic to) maps in \(\underline{E}\),
and we conclude that the 2-fiber product is the space \(E\).
The map \(\pi\colon E \to Y\) is an open surjection which admits local sections
because \(E\) is a principal \(\mathcal{G}\)-bundle.
Therefore the map \(p\colon \mathcal{G}_0 \to \mathsf{B}\mathcal{G}\) is an atlas.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The purpose of this post is to single out the topological (or geometric or Artin) stacks.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Pursued By Stacks 7: Appendix</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2022/05/19/Pursued-by-Stacks-7-Appendix.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Pursued By Stacks 7: Appendix" /><published>2022-05-19T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2022-05-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2022/05/19/Pursued-by-Stacks-7:-Appendix</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2022/05/19/Pursued-by-Stacks-7-Appendix.html">&lt;p&gt;This post is, strictly speaking, a follow up to &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/05/17/Pursued-by-Stacks-3-We-Need-A-Lemma.html&quot;&gt;part three&lt;/a&gt; of my series on stacks,
on the 2-Yoneda lemma.
The classical Yoneda lemma has built into it a naturality statement,
while our 2-Yoneda lemma proved essentially only the fact of the isomorphism.
Let’s fix that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem.&lt;/strong&gt; (The 2-Yoneda Lemma)
 The functor 
 \(\operatorname{よ}\colon \operatorname{Hom}(\underline{X},\mathsf{D}) \to \mathsf{D}(X)\)
 defined on objects as \((F\colon \underline{X} \to \mathsf{D}) \mapsto F(1_X)\)
 and on arrows as \((\alpha\colon F \Rightarrow G) \mapsto \alpha(1_X)\)
 is an equivalence of categories which is pseudonatural in both arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have proved all but the (pseudo)-naturality statement,
which is a little convoluted for the following reason.
You see, typically you think of the Yoneda lemma as being about, for instance,
natural transformations from the hom-set functor 
\(\mathsf{C}(\underline{X},\cdot)\) to a functor \(F\).
Now, \(\underline{X}\) is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the functor \(\mathbf{Top}(X,\cdot)\),
but rather the functor \(\mathbf{Top}(\cdot,X)\) which we think of as being valued not in sets,
but in categories (groupoids, actually),
where the category is the rather uninteresting discrete category
comprising an object for each map \(Y \to X\) and only the identity arrows.
Given a map \(h \colon Y \to Z\), 
we get a functor \(h^*\colon \underline{X}(Z) \to \underline{X}(Y)\) 
given by \(h^*(g\colon Z \to X) = gh \colon Y \to X\).
This is actually a functor 
(I say, just because I can anticipate that I’m about to write down a not-quite-a-functor).
The only natural transformation between functors is the identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the point is, we should be expecting to suddenly start thinking of
an arbitrary category fibered in groupoids \(\mathsf{D}\) as a &lt;em&gt;contravariant&lt;/em&gt; functor
from \(\mathsf{Top}\) to the category of categories (groupoids, actually),
where the category is \(\mathsf{D}(Y)\).
Given a map \(h \colon Y \to Z\),
we should get a functor \(h^*\colon \mathsf{D}(Z) \to \mathsf{D}(Y)\)
given by \(h^*(\xi) = h^*\xi\)
and we do, actually. The problem, which we mumbled something about earlier,
is that given \(g \colon X \to Y\), we don’t necessarily have \(g^*h^*\xi = (hg)^*\xi\),
merely that they’re canonically isomorphic.
In other words, the operation \((\cdot)^*\) is not a contravariant functor,
just one up to canonical isomorphism.
I super don’t actually want to learn what a pseudofunctor is, but I guess that’s what this is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-digression-pseudofunctors&quot;&gt;A digression: pseudofunctors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s go slowly: for each object \(X\) in \(\mathbf{Top}\) 
we have an object in the category of groupoids, namely the groupoid \(\mathsf{D}(X)\).
If we think of the hom-set \(\mathbf{Top}(X,Y)\) as a discrete groupoid,
we get a &lt;em&gt;covariant&lt;/em&gt; functor defined &lt;em&gt;contravariantly&lt;/em&gt; on objects (which are maps!) 
as \((f\colon X\to Y) \mapsto f^*\colon \mathsf{D}(Y) \to \mathsf{D}(X)\).
We saw that this is in fact a functor, since given \(\alpha \colon \xi \to \xi&apos;\),
there is a unique arrow \(f^*\alpha \colon f^*\xi \to f^*\xi&apos;\).
The arrows of the category \(\mathbf{Top}(X,Y)\) are the identity natural isomorphism,
which must go to the identity natural transformation of \(f^*\).
Now, I think we’ve insisted that \(1_X^*\xi = \xi\), 
and indeed if you pull back a bundle along the identity map, 
I think it’s fair to say that you get the same bundle.
This is secretly good, because it lets us ignore isomorphisms involving the identity,
since they are equalities.
Now for the hard part. Given \(f\colon X \to Y\) and \(g \colon Y \to Z\),
by the defining property of a category fibered in groupoids, 
for each \(\xi \in \mathsf{D}(Z)\),
there is a unique isomorphism \(\eta{f,g}(\xi)\) making the following diagram commute&lt;/p&gt;

\[\require{AMScd}\begin{CD}
f^*g^*\xi @&amp;gt;g_{\xi}f_{g^*\xi}&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi \\
@VV\eta{f,g}(\xi)V @| \\
(gf)^*\xi @&amp;gt;(gf)_{\xi}&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi.
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;Notice that given an arrow \(\alpha\colon \xi \to \xi&apos;\),
the following diagram commutes&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
f^*g^*\xi @&amp;gt;\eta_{f,g}(\xi)&amp;gt;&amp;gt; (gf)^*\xi \\
@VVf^*g^*\alpha V @VV(gf)^*\alpha V \\
f^*g^*\xi&apos; @&amp;gt;\eta_{f,g}(\xi&apos;)&amp;gt;&amp;gt; (gf)^*\xi&apos;.
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;This is because of the defining property of categories fibered in groupoids:
both paths around the square make the following diagram commute&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
f^*g^*\xi @&amp;gt;\alpha g_\xi f_{g^*\xi}&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi&apos; \\
@VVV @| \\
(gf)^*\xi&apos; @&amp;gt;(gf)_{\xi&apos;}&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi&apos;;
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;indeed we calculate&lt;/p&gt;

\[\alpha g_\xi f_{g^*\xi} = g_{\xi&apos;} g^*\alpha f_{g^*\xi} = g_{\xi&apos;} f_{g^*\xi&apos;} f^*g^*\alpha
= (gf)_{\xi&apos;} \eta_{f,g}(\xi&apos;) f^*g^*\alpha\]

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

\[\alpha g_\xi f_{g^*\xi} = \alpha (gf)_\xi \eta_{f,g}(\xi) 
= (gf)_{\xi&apos;} (gf)^*\alpha \eta_{f,g}(\xi).\]

&lt;p&gt;My source (nLab, gulp) suggests that the isomorphism \(\eta_{f,g}\) 
should be natural in \(f\) and \(g\).
Notice that if \(f \ne f&apos;\), then there are no natural transformations (isomorphisms)
\(f^* \Rightarrow f&apos;^*\).
On the other hand, a family of arrows \(\alpha(\xi) \colon f^*\xi \to f^*\xi\),
define a natural isomorphism \(\alpha \colon f^*\Rightarrow f^*\)
if for each \(\beta \colon \xi \to \xi&apos;\) in the fiber over \(\mathsf{Y}\), we have
\(\alpha(\xi&apos;)f^*\beta = f^*\beta\alpha(\xi)\).
Naturality in \(f\), then, is the statement that given \(\alpha\colon f^* \Rightarrow f^*\),
the following diagram commutes&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
f^*g^*\xi @&amp;gt;\eta_{f,g}(\xi)&amp;gt;&amp;gt; (gf)^*\xi \\
@VV\alpha(g^*\xi)V @VVV \\
f^*g^*\xi @&amp;gt;\eta_{f,g}(\xi)&amp;gt;&amp;gt; (gf)^*\xi
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;which can only hold if the righthand arrow is 
\(\eta_{f,g}(\xi)\alpha(g^*\xi)\eta_{f,g}(\xi)^{-1}\),
and indeed, I see no other sensible way to define an arrow \((gf)^*\xi \to (gf)^*\xi\)
out of one from \(f^*\xi \to f^*\xi\).
Naturality in \(g\) should be similarly silly; I’ll leave it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since function composition is strictly associative (phew)
we just need to check that the following diagram commutes for each \(\xi \in \mathsf{D}(W)\)
and each triple of maps \(f\colon X \to Y\), \(g\colon Y \to Z\) and \(h\colon Z \to W\)&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
f^*g^*h^*\xi @&amp;gt;f^*(\eta_{g,h}(\xi))&amp;gt;&amp;gt; f^*(hg)^* \xi \\
@VV\eta_{f,g}(h^*\xi)V @VV\eta_{f,gh}(\xi)V \\
(gf)^*h^*\xi @&amp;gt;\eta_{gf,h}(\xi)&amp;gt;&amp;gt; (hgf)^*\xi.
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;This will use our only trick: consider the diagram&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
f^*g^*h^*\xi @&amp;gt;h_{\xi}g_{h^*\xi}f_{g^*h^*\xi}&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi \\
@VVV @| \\
(hgf)^*\xi @&amp;gt;(hgf)_\xi&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi.
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;We calculate:&lt;/p&gt;

\[h_\xi g_{h^*\xi} f_{g^*h^*\xi} = (hg)_\xi \eta_{g,h}(\xi) f_{g^*h^*\xi}
= (hg)_\xi f_{(hg)^*\xi} f^*(\eta_{g,h}(\xi)) = (hgf)_\xi \eta_{f,gh}(\xi) f^*(\eta_{g,h}(\xi))\]

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

\[h_\xi g_{h^*\xi} f_{g^*h^*\xi} = h_\xi (gf)_{h^*\xi} \eta_{f,g}(h^*\xi)
= (hgf)_\xi \eta_{gf,h}(\xi) \eta_{f,g}(h^*\xi).\]

&lt;p&gt;Therefore by the defining property of categories fibered in groupoids,
we have the coherence of the associating isomorphism.
The argument above is summarized in the commuting cube below,
where the unlabeled arrows are the “obvious” ones, for instance \(h_\xi \colon h^*\xi \to \xi\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2naturality.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;The commuting cube demonstrating the coherence of isomorphisms.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pseudonaturality-in-underlinex&quot;&gt;Pseudonaturality in \(\underline{X}\)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay enough about pseudofunctors.
We already saw in a previous post that functors \(\underline{Y} \to \underline{X}\)
are maps \(f\colon Y \to X\).
(Indeed, the proof uses the first part of the 2-Yoneda lemma.)
Such a functor gives us a functor 
\(f^*\colon \operatorname{Hom}(\underline{X},\mathsf{D}) 
\to \operatorname{Hom}(\underline{Y},\mathsf{D})\)
defined on objects (functors)
as \(f^*F = Ff\) and on arrows (natural transformations)
as \(f^*(\alpha \colon F \Rightarrow G) = \alpha f \colon Ff \Rightarrow Gf\).
On the other side of the equation,
we have the functor \(f^*\colon \mathsf{D}(X) \to \mathsf{D}(Y)\)
defined extensively above.
Pseudonaturality in \(X\) then is the claim that the following diagram commutes&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
\operatorname{Hom}(\underline{X},\mathsf{D}) @&amp;gt;\operatorname{よ}_X&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \mathsf{D}(X) \\
@VVf^*V @VVf^*V \\
\operatorname{Hom}(\underline{Y},\mathsf{D}) @&amp;gt;\operatorname{よ}_Y&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \mathsf{D}(Y).
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;up to a natural transformation.
And indeed, if \(F(1_X) = \xi \in \mathsf{D}(X)\), we have
\(f^*\operatorname{よ}_X(F) = f^*\xi\)
and \(\operatorname{よ}_Y(f^*F) = (f^*F)(1_Y) = F(f\colon Y \to X)\).
Now, recall from &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/05/17/Pursued-by-Stacks-3-We-Need-A-Lemma.html&quot;&gt;part three&lt;/a&gt; that we write \(F(Y)\), since \(f\colon Y \to X\) is understood
and we’d like to consider the arrow \(F(f) \colon F(Y) \to \xi\).
By the definition of categories fibered in groupoids, there is a unique isomorphism
\(\sigma_{F,f}\colon F(Y) \to f^*\xi\) satisfying \(f_\xi \sigma_{F,f} = F(f)\).
We claim that \(\sigma_{F,f}\) defines a natural transformation making the diagram above commute.
This is the claim that for every natural transformation \(\alpha\colon F\Rightarrow G\)
in \(\operatorname{Hom}(\underline{X},\mathsf{D})\),
the following diagram commutes in \(\mathsf{D}(Y)\):&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
\operatorname{よ}_Y(f^*F) @&amp;gt;\sigma_{F,f}&amp;gt;&amp;gt; f^*\operatorname{よ}_X(F) \\
@VV\operatorname{よ}_Y(f^*\alpha)V @VVf^*\operatorname{よ}_X(\alpha)V \\
 \operatorname{よ}_Y(f^*G) @&amp;gt;\sigma_{G,f}&amp;gt;&amp;gt; f^*\operatorname{よ}_X(G).
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;Unwound slightly, if we write \(G(X) = \xi&apos;\) and \(\alpha \colon \xi \to \xi&apos;\),
this is the same diagram as&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
F(Y) @&amp;gt;\sigma_{F,f}&amp;gt;&amp;gt; f^*\xi \\
@VV\alpha(Y)V @VVf^*\alpha V \\
G(Y) @&amp;gt;\sigma_{F,f}&amp;gt;&amp;gt; f^*\xi&apos;.
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;The commutativity of this diagram uses our only trick, 
namely the unique way of filling this diagram:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
F(Y) @&amp;gt;\alpha F(f)&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi&apos; \\
@VVV @| \\
f^*\xi&apos; @&amp;gt;f_{\xi&apos;}&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi&apos;.
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;We check&lt;/p&gt;

\[\alpha F(f) = \alpha f_\xi \sigma_{F,f} = f_{\xi&apos;} f^*\alpha \sigma_{F,f}\]

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

\[\alpha F(f) =  G(f)\alpha(Y) = f_{\xi&apos;} \sigma_{G,f} \alpha(Y).\]

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-loose-end-from-part-six&quot;&gt;A loose end from part six&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this proves a claim from &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/05/19/Pursued-by-Stacks-6-Stacks-and-Groupoids.html&quot;&gt;part six&lt;/a&gt;. 
Let’s test it out.
An object \(\xi \in \mathsf{D}(Y)\) is a map \(f\colon \underline{Y} \to \mathsf{D}\).
Similarly \(\xi&apos; \in \mathsf{D}(X)\) is a map \(g\colon \underline{X} \to \mathsf{D}\).
An arrow \(\tilde h \colon \xi \to \xi&apos;\) over a map \(h\colon Y \to X\)
should be the map \(h \colon Y \to X\) together with a natural transformation
\(\alpha\colon f \Rightarrow gh\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me write things a little more like the above. 
So we have \(\xi \in \mathsf{D}(Y)\) 
equal under \(\operatorname{よ}_Y\) to \(F\colon \underline{Y} \to \mathsf{D}\),
and similarly \(\xi&apos; = \operatorname{よ}_X(G)\).
We have the functor \(\mathsf{D}(h) = h^*\colon \mathsf{D}(X) \to \mathsf{D}(Y)\)
which corresponds up to natural transformation to precomposition by \(h\colon Y \to X\).
There is a unique isomorphism \(\beta\) making the following diagram commute&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
\xi @&amp;gt;\tilde h&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi&apos; \\
@VV\beta V @| \\
h^*\xi&apos; @&amp;gt;h_{\xi&apos;}&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi&apos; \\
@AA\sigma_{G,h}A @| \\
Gh(1_Y) @&amp;gt;G(h)&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi&apos;
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;We claim that \(\sigma_{G,h}^{-1}\beta\) comes from (or defines) a unique natural transformation
\(\alpha \colon F \Rightarrow Gh\) 
(we write \(Gh\) to avoid confusion with the functor \(h^*\)).
At an object \(k \colon Z \to Y\) of \(\underline{Y}\),
define \(\alpha(Z) = \sigma_{G,hk}^{-1} \eta_{k,h}(\xi&apos;) k^*\beta \sigma_{F,k}\),
where \(\eta_{k,h}(\xi&apos;) \colon k^*h^*\xi&apos; \to (hk)^*\xi&apos;\) 
is the isomorphism defined in the previous section.
Given another object \(\ell \colon W \to Y\) and an arrow \(m \colon Z \to W\),
we need the following diagram to commute&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
F(Z) @&amp;gt;\alpha(Z)&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Gh(Z) \\
@VVF(m)V @VVGh(m)V \\
F(W) @&amp;gt;\alpha(W)&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Gh(W).
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;Let’s try putting both paths around the square into the diagram&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
F(Z) @&amp;gt;\tilde h F(k)&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi&apos; \\
@VVV @| \\
Gh(W) @&amp;gt;G(h)Gh(\ell)&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi&apos;.
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;We calculate&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{gather*}
G(h)Gh(\ell)Gh(m) \alpha(Z) = G(h)Gh(k)\alpha(Z) = G(hk)\alpha(Z) \\
= (hk)_{\xi&apos;} \sigma_{G,hk} \alpha(Z) = (hk)_{\xi&apos;} \eta_{k,h}(\xi&apos;) k^*\beta \sigma_{F,k} \\
= h_{\xi&apos;}k_{h^*\xi&apos;} k^*\beta \sigma_{F,k} = h_{\xi&apos;} \beta k_\xi \sigma_{F,k}
= h_{\xi&apos;}\beta F(k) = \tilde h F(k)
\end{gather*}\]

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{gather*}
G(h)Gh(\ell)\alpha(W)F(m) = G(h\ell)\alpha(W)F(m) = (h\ell)_{\xi&apos;}\sigma_{G,h\ell}\alpha(W)F(m) \\
= (h\ell)_{\xi&apos;} \eta_{\ell,h}(\xi&apos;) \ell^*\beta \sigma_{F,\ell} F(m)
= h_{\xi&apos;}\ell_{h^*\xi&apos;} \ell^*\beta \sigma_{F,\ell} F(m) \\
= h_{\xi&apos;}\beta \ell_\xi \sigma_{F,\ell} F(m) = h_{\xi&apos;} \beta F(\ell)F(m) = h_{\xi&apos;}\beta F(k)
= \tilde h F(k).
\end{gather*}\]

&lt;p&gt;The argument is summarized in the following interesting commutative diagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2naturality2.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;The argument above in commutative diagram form&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely it is clear that given such an \(\alpha \colon F \Rightarrow Gh\), 
we get a map \(\tilde h \colon \xi \to \xi&apos;\)
defined by \(G(h)\alpha(Y)\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pseudonaturality-in-mathsfd&quot;&gt;Pseudonaturality in \(\mathsf{D}\)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now suppose we have a map of categories fibered in groupoids 
\(f\colon \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{D}\).
This is by definition a functor \(f\colon \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{D}\)
such that \(\pi f = \pi\).
For each \(\xi \in \mathsf{C}(X)\), we get an object \(f(\xi) \in \mathsf{D}(X)\),
and for each arrow \(\alpha \colon \xi \to \xi&apos;\) in the fiber, 
we get an arrow \(f(\alpha)\colon f(\xi) \to f(\xi&apos;)\) in the fiber.
In other words, we get a functor \(f|_X \colon \mathsf{C}(X) \to \mathsf{D}(X)\).
Given a functor \(F\colon \underline{X} \to \mathsf{C}\), postcomposition with \(f\)
yields a functor \(f_*F = fF \colon \underline{X} \to \mathsf{D}\).
Similarly given a natural transformation \(\alpha\colon F\Rightarrow G\),
we get \(f_*\alpha \colon f_*F\Rightarrow f_*G\).
Pseudonaturality in \(\mathsf{D}\) is the claim that the following diagram commutes&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
\operatorname{Hom}(\underline{X},\mathsf{C}) @&amp;gt;\operatorname{よ}_{\mathsf{C}}&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \mathsf{C}(X) \\
@VVf_*V @VVf|_XV \\
\operatorname{Hom}(\underline{X},\mathsf{D}) @&amp;gt;\operatorname{よ}_{\mathsf{D}}&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \mathsf{D}(X)
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;up to a natural transformation.
And indeed, if we write \(F(1_X) = \xi\), \(G(1_X) = \xi&apos;\)
and \(\alpha(1_X) = \alpha \colon \xi \to \xi&apos;\), we actually have&lt;/p&gt;

\[f|_X\operatorname{よ}_{\mathsf{C}}(F) = f|_X(\xi) = f(\xi) = f_*F(1_X) 
= \operatorname{よ}_{\mathsf{D}}(f_*F)\]

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

\[f|_X\operatorname{よ}_{\mathsf{C}}(\alpha) = f|_X(\alpha) = f(\alpha) = f_*\alpha(1_X)
= \operatorname{よ}_{\mathsf{D}}(f_*\alpha),\]

&lt;p&gt;so the diagram actually commutes on the nose.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This post is, strictly speaking, a follow up to part three of my series on stacks, on the 2-Yoneda lemma.

Actually, the nLab tells me such stacks are called &lt;em&gt;topological,&lt;/em&gt; so I’ll try and say that.
But! Before we get there, we need the construction 
of the 2-fiber product of categories fibered in groupoids over \(\mathbf{Top}\).
The purpose of this post is to discuss this construction, which I think is adorable.
I cannot shake the feeling that I’ve talked through the 2-fiber product of categories
before, but I have no idea where or why I might have done this
except possibly the last time I tried to learn about stacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friends of the blog &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/06/17/Pullbacks-and-Intersections.html&quot;&gt;will recall&lt;/a&gt; the categorical definition of a pullback.
This notion makes sense for categories (after all, categories assemble into a category),
but because of the existence of natural transformations, the universal property looks
a little bit different.
Namely, suppose we have three categories \(\mathsf{C}\), \(\mathsf{D}\) and \(\mathsf{E}\)
and two functors \(F\colon \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{E}\) and \(G\colon \mathsf{D} \to \mathsf{E}\).
The &lt;em&gt;2-fiber product&lt;/em&gt; \(\mathsf{C}\times_{\mathsf{E}} \mathsf{D}\) makes the following diagram
commute&lt;/p&gt;

\[\require{AMScd}\begin{CD}
\mathsf{C}\times_{\mathsf{E}}\mathsf{D} @&amp;gt;\pi_1&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \mathsf{C} \\
@V\pi_2VV @VFVV \\
\mathsf{D} @&amp;gt;G&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \mathsf{E}
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;up to natural isomorphism \(\eta\colon F\pi_1 \Rightarrow G\pi_2\)
and is &lt;em&gt;universal&lt;/em&gt; for this property in the following slightly complicated sense.
Given any category \(\mathsf{X}\), maps \(H\colon \mathsf{X} \to \mathsf{C}\)
and \(K\colon \mathsf{X} \to \mathsf{D}\)
with a natural isomorphism \(\epsilon \colon FH \Rightarrow GK\),
there is a functor \(P\colon\mathsf{X} \to \mathsf{C}\times_{\mathsf{E}}\mathsf{D}\)
and natural isomorphisms \(\alpha\colon H \Rightarrow \pi_1P\) 
and \(\beta\colon K\Rightarrow \pi_2P\)
with the property that \((G\beta)^{-1} \circ \eta P \circ F\alpha = \epsilon\).
This is summarized in the following diagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/2pullback.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;The 2-pullback diagram&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given another functor \(Q\colon \mathsf{X} \to \mathsf{C}\times_{\mathsf{E}}\mathsf{D}\)
and natural isomorphisms \(\gamma\colon H\Rightarrow \pi_1Q\)
and \(\delta\colon K \Rightarrow \pi_2Q\) as above,
there exists a unique natural isomorphism \(\lambda \colon P \Rightarrow Q\)
with the property that \(\pi_1\lambda \colon \pi_1P \Rightarrow \pi_1Q\)
equals \(\gamma\circ\alpha^{-1}\) and \(\pi_2\lambda = \delta\circ\beta^{-1}\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of categories fibered in groupoids over \(\mathbf{Top}\),
the 2-fiber product has the following definition.
Objects of \(\mathsf{C}\times_{\mathsf{E}} \mathsf{D}\) are triples
\((c,d,\alpha)\), where \(c \in \mathsf{C}\) and \(d \in \mathsf{D}\) are objects
over the same space \(X\)
and \(\alpha\colon F(c) \to G(d)\) is an arrow over the identity map of \(X\).
Arrows of \(\mathsf{C}\times_{\mathsf{E}}\mathsf{D}\) are pairs of arrows
\(u\colon c_1 \to c_2\) and \(v\colon d_1 \to d_2\)
over the same map of spaces \(f\colon X \to Y\)
with the property that the following diagram commutes in \(\mathsf{E}\)&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
F(c_1) @&amp;gt;\alpha_1&amp;gt;&amp;gt; G(d_1) \\
@VVF(u)V @VVG(v)V \\
F(c_2) @&amp;gt;\alpha_2&amp;gt;&amp;gt; G(d_2).
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;There is an obvious functor \(\pi\colon \mathsf{C}\times_{\mathsf{E}}\mathsf{D} \to \mathbf{Top}\)
sending an object \((c,d,\alpha)\) to the space \(X\) that \(c\) and \(d\) are over
and sending an arrow \((u,v)\) to the map \(f\colon X \to Y\) that \(u\) and \(v\) are over.
We’d like to show that \(\mathsf{C}\times_{\mathsf{E}}\mathsf{D}\) is fibered in groupoids.
Given an object \(\xi = (c,d,\alpha)\) over \(X\) and a map \(f\colon Y \to X\),
we need a “pullback” \(f^*\xi\) over \(Y\).
It would be simplest to define \(f^*\xi = (f^*c,f^*d,f^*\alpha)\),
but we don’t necessarily have \(f^*F(c) = F(f^*c)\), 
merely that they are canonically isomorphic via an isomorphism 
\(\sigma_{F,f}\colon F(f^*c) \to f^*F(c)\)
such that \(F(f_c) = f_{F(c)} \sigma_{F,f}\).
So we will in fact define \(f^\xi = (f^*c, f^*d, \sigma_{G,f}^{-1} f^*\alpha \sigma_{F,f})\).
The map \(f_\xi \colon f^*\xi \to \xi\)
is the map \((f_c,f_d)\). We check&lt;/p&gt;

\[\alpha F(f_c) = \alpha f_{F(c)} \sigma_{F,f} = f_{G(d)} f^*\alpha \sigma_{F,f} 
= G(f_d) \sigma_{G,f}^{-1} f^*\alpha \sigma_{F,f},\]

&lt;p&gt;so this really does give a map \(f_\xi \colon f^*\xi \to \xi\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given a pair of arrows \((u_1,v_1)\colon (c_1,d_1,\alpha_1) \to (c,d,\alpha)\)
and \((u_2,v_2)\colon (c_2,d_2,\alpha_2) \to (c,d,\alpha)\)
over maps \(f \colon Y \to X\) and \(g\colon Z \to X\)
such that there exists a map of spaces \(h\colon Y \to Z\) with \(gh = f\),
we need a unique pair of maps \(h_{\mathsf{C}}\colon c_1 \to c_2\) and 
\(h_{\mathsf{D}}\colon d_1 \to d_2\)
such that the relevant diagram commutes.
But observe that because \(u_1\) and \(u_2\) are over \(f\) and \(g\),
there does exist a unique map \(h_{\mathsf{C}}\colon c_1 \to c_2\)
and similarly a unique map \(h_{\mathsf{D}}\colon d_1 \to d_2\) lifting the diagram \(gh = f\).
We need to check that the following diagram commutes&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
F(c_1) @&amp;gt;\alpha_1&amp;gt;&amp;gt; G(d_1) \\
@VVF(h_{\mathsf{C}})V @VVG(h_{\mathsf{D}})V \\
F(c_2) @&amp;gt;\alpha_2&amp;gt;&amp;gt; G(d_2).
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;We will show this by the strategy from the last post:
fitting both paths around the square into the vertical arrow in the following diagram&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
F(c_1) @&amp;gt;\alpha F(u_1)&amp;gt;&amp;gt; G(d) \\
@VVV @| \\
G(d_2) @&amp;gt;G(v_2)&amp;gt;&amp;gt; G(d);
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;uniqueness then assures equality of the paths around the square.
We have&lt;/p&gt;

\[\alpha F(u_1) = G(v_1)\alpha_1 = G(v_2)G(h_{\mathsf{D}})\alpha_1.\]

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand we have&lt;/p&gt;

\[\alpha F(u_1) = \alpha F(u_2)F(h_{\mathsf{C}}) = G(v_2) \alpha_2 F(h_{\mathsf{C}}),\]

&lt;p&gt;how satisfying! This shows that the 2-fiber product really is fibered in groupoids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, we have obvious projections \(\mathsf{C}\times_{\mathsf{E}}\mathsf{D}\)
to \(\mathsf{C}\) and \(\mathsf{D}\).
Call these \(\pi_1\) and \(\pi_2\).
We do not quite have \(F\pi_1 = G\pi_2\),
merely that there is a natural isomorphism \(\eta\colon F\pi_1 \Rightarrow G\pi_2\)
defined by \(\eta(c,d,\alpha) = \alpha\)! Adorable, right?
Showing that \(\eta\) really is natural is cute, but I’ll leave it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, are you still thinking vector bundles? I know I am;
it’s helpful to pretend that there really is a projection from \(\xi \in \mathsf{C}\)
down to the space \(X\) it is over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-universal-property&quot;&gt;The universal property&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to conclude this post by showing that the fiber product 
really has its universal property.
Given a category \(\mathsf{X}\) fibered in groupoids over \(\mathbf{Top}\)
with functors \(H \colon \mathsf{X} \to \mathsf{C}\) and \(K\colon \mathsf{X} \to \mathsf{D}\)
and a natural isomorphism \(\epsilon\colon FH \Rightarrow GK\),
the obvious functor \(P\) to \(\mathsf{C}\times_{\mathsf{E}}\mathsf{D}\)
is defined on objects as \(x \mapsto (H(x),K(x),\epsilon(x))\)
and on arrows \((u\colon x \to y) \mapsto (H(u),K(u))\).
Naturality of \(\epsilon\) assures that this is really a functor.
In this case, the isomorphisms \(\alpha\colon H \Rightarrow \pi_1P\) 
and \(\beta\colon K \Rightarrow \pi_2P\)
are the identity: these diagrams commute on the nose.
Now suppose we have another functor 
\(Q\colon \mathsf{X} \to \mathsf{C}\times_{\mathsf{E}}\mathsf{D}\)
and natural isomorphisms \(\gamma \colon H \Rightarrow \pi_1Q\)
and \(\delta\colon K \Rightarrow \pi_2Q\).
Define \(\lambda \colon P \Rightarrow Q\) by the rule
\(\lambda(x) = (\gamma(x),\delta(x))\colon (H(x),K(x),\epsilon(x)) \to Q(x)\).
We write \(Q(x) = (c,d,\alpha)\). We need the following diagram to commute&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
FH(x) @&amp;gt;\epsilon(x)&amp;gt;&amp;gt; GK(x) \\
@VVF\gamma(x)V @VVG\delta(x)V \\
F(c) @&amp;gt;\alpha&amp;gt;&amp;gt; G(d).
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;But this is exactly the condition at \(x\) for the equality
\((G\delta)^{-1}\eta Q F\gamma = \epsilon\),
so \(\lambda(x)\) really defines an arrow.
Given an arrow \(u\colon x \to y\) in \(\mathsf{X}\),
we need to check naturality:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
(H(x),K(x),\epsilon(x)) @&amp;gt;\lambda(x)&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Q(x) \\
@VV(H(u),K(u))V @VVQ(u)V \\
(H(y),K(y),\epsilon(y)) @&amp;gt;\lambda(y)&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Q(y).
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;This is true in each factor, for example in \(\mathsf{C}\) we have
\(\pi_1 Q(u) \gamma(x) = \gamma(y) H(u)\).
Therefore both paths around the square give equal arrows.
It is clear from the construction that \(\lambda\) is unique.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Okay, we’re closing in on the definition of a geometric stack over \(\mathbf{Top}\).

We’d like to know what a &lt;em&gt;geometric&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Artin&lt;/em&gt; stack over \(\mathbf{Top}\) is,
since these are the stacks that correspond to, e.g. graphs of groups.
To get there, I’m told, Yoneda lemma (sorry sorry).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re trying to follow who I’m following,
we’re back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ems.press/content/serial-article-files/6839&quot;&gt;Lerman&lt;/a&gt;,
for no particular reason other than I find it helpful to bounce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-2-yoneda-lemma&quot;&gt;The 2-Yoneda lemma&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2-Yoneda lemma works for categories fibered in groupoids over any category,
but to keep things hopefully slightly clearer I will continue to speak of our base category
as \(\mathbf{Top}\).
Given a space \(X\), there is a category fibered in groupoids over \(\mathbf{Top}\),
namely the &lt;em&gt;slice category&lt;/em&gt; \(\mathbf{Top}/X = \underline{X}\).
The objects of \(\underline{X}\) are maps with codomain \(X\)
and arrows are maps of the domains making the diagram below commute&lt;/p&gt;

\[\require{AMScd}\begin{CD}
Y @&amp;gt;f&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Z \\
@VVV @VVV \\
X @= X
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;where the vertical maps are the defining maps of the objects.
The projection \(\underline{X} \to \mathbf{Top}\) sends an object, which is a map \(Y \to X\)
to its domain \(Y\),
and sends an arrow to the corresponding map of domains.
Notationally, this category is very frustrating to work with,
since both objects and arrows are maps, and we’ll want to use a single map as both.
Lerman solves this problem with the power of TikZ, which we don’t have here in blog land.
I will attempt to solve this by referring to objects of \(\underline{X}\)
by their domain when I can,
and saving the maps for referring to arrows.
Thus, for example, if \(F\) is a functor with domain \(\underline{X}\),
after specifying that I am considering \(f\colon Y \to X\),
I will write \(F(Y)\) the image of \(f\colon Y \to X\) under \(F\),
and write \(F(f)\) for the image of the arrow that is secretly the following diagram&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
Y @&amp;gt;f&amp;gt;&amp;gt; X \\
@VfVV @V1_XVV \\
X @= X.
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;You see? Clear as mud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pasting Lemma from general topology, essentially,
tells us that \(\underline{X}\) is actually a stack.
(Given a map to \(X\) defined on an open cover of a space \(Y\)
with isomorphisms between double intersections 
satisfying the cocycle condition on triple intersections,
there is certainly a map \(Y \to X\), so every descent datum is effective.
What’s more, an isomorphism over \(X\) between \(Y\) and \(Y&apos;\) is definitely
determined by its restriction to an open cover, so isomorphisms form a sheaf.)
We don’t need that at the moment, but it will be useful later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall that natural transformations (necessarily isomorphisms)
between maps (functors) of categories fibered in groupoids
make the collection (ack, is it a set??)
of maps \(F\colon \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{D}\) into a category (necessarily a groupoid)
called \(\operatorname{Hom}(\mathsf{C},\mathsf{D})\).
Similarly, given a category fibered in groupoids \(\mathsf{D}\)
and a space \(X\), there is a category \(\mathsf{D}(X)\)
comprising all those objects \(\xi \in \mathsf{D}\) with \(\pi(\xi) = X\),
where arrows are arrows \(f\colon \xi \to \xi&apos;\) in \(\mathsf{D}\)
with the property that \(\pi(f) = 1_X\).
Ahh, this latter category is probably not small in general,
but maybe there are standard(?) tricks you can do to show it is equivalent to a small category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem.&lt;/strong&gt; (The 2-Yoneda Lemma)
 The functor 
 \(\operatorname{よ}\colon \operatorname{Hom}(\underline{X},\mathsf{D}) \to \mathsf{D}(X)\)
 defined on objects (functors) as 
 \((F\colon \underline{X} \to \mathsf{D}) \mapsto F(1_X\colon X \to X)\)
 and on arrows (natural transformations) as
 \((\alpha\colon F \Rightarrow G) \mapsto (\alpha(1_X)\colon F(1_X) \to G(1_X))\)
 is an equivalence of categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In more words, the functor \(\operatorname{よ}\) sends a functor \(F\) to its
action on the map \(1_X \colon X \to X\) in \(\underline{X}\)
and sends a natural transformation \(\alpha\) between functors \(F\) and \(G\)
to its action on the map \(1_X \colon X \to X\),
which happens to be (by the definition of a natural transformation)
an arrow from \(F(1_X)\) to \(G(1_X)\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proof.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
First notice that \(\operatorname{よ}(F)\) is definitely an object over \(X\),
since maps of categories fibered in groupoids preserve the projection to \(\mathbf{Top}\).
Similarly, since natural transformations are over the identity of \(\mathbf{Top}\),
\(\operatorname{よ}(\alpha)\) is definitely over \(1_X\).
Therefore the map is well-defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next observe that
\(\operatorname{よ}(1_F \colon F \Rightarrow F) = 1_F(1_X) \colon F(1_X) \to F(1_X)\)
is in fact the identity arrow of \(1_X \colon X \to X\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now suppose that we have \(\alpha\colon F \Rightarrow G\) and \(\beta\colon G \Rightarrow H\).
We have&lt;/p&gt;

\[\operatorname{よ}(\beta\alpha) = (\beta\alpha)(1_X) 
= \beta(1_X)\alpha(1_X) = \operatorname{よ}(\beta)\operatorname{よ}(\alpha)\]

&lt;p&gt;so \(\operatorname{よ}\) is indeed a functor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To show that \(\operatorname{よ}\) is an equivalence of categories we will show that
it is full, faithful and essentially surjective.
Suppose \(F\) and \(G\) are functors \(\underline{X} \to \mathsf{D}\).
Write \(X\) for the object \(1_X \colon X \to X\) in \(\underline{X}\), and
write \(F(X) = \xi\) and \(G(X) = \xi&apos;\).
Given a map of spaces \(f\colon Y \to X\),
there is by the definition of categories fibered in groupoids,
a unique isomorphism \(\sigma_{F,f}\colon F(Y) \to f^*\xi\) 
with the property that the following diagram commutes&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
F(Y) @&amp;gt;F(f)&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi \\
@V\sigma_{F,f}VV @| \\
f^*\xi @&amp;gt;f_\xi&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi.
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;There is also the pullback isomorphism \(f^*a\colon f^*\xi \to f^*\xi&apos;\).
We define the action of our putative natural transformation \(\alpha\colon F \Rightarrow G\)
as \(\alpha(Y) = \sigma_{G,f}^{-1}\circ f^*a\circ\sigma_{F,f}\).
Given another map \(g\colon Z \to X\) and an arrow \(h \colon Y \to Z\) in \(\underline{X}\),
we trace the naturality square:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
F(Y) @&amp;gt;\sigma_{G,f}^{-1}\circ f^*a\circ\sigma_{F,f}&amp;gt;&amp;gt; G(Y) \\
@VF(h)VV @VG(h)VV \\
F(Z) @&amp;gt;\sigma_{G,g}^{-1}\circ g^*a\circ\sigma_{F,g}&amp;gt;&amp;gt; G(Z).
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;We claim that both paths around the square fit into the 
unlabeled vertical arrow in the following diagram
to make it commute&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
F(Y) @&amp;gt;aF(f)&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi&apos; \\
@VVV @| \\
G(Z) @&amp;gt;G(g)&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi&apos;.
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, we have&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{gather*}aF(f) = af_\xi\sigma_{F,f} = f_{\xi&apos;}f^*a\sigma_{F,f} 
= G(f)\sigma_{G,f}^{-1} f^*a \sigma_{F,f} \\
= G(g) \circ G(h) \sigma_{G,f}^{-1} f^*a \sigma_{F,f}.
\end{gather*}\]

&lt;p&gt;But on the other hand, we also have&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{gather*}
aF(f) = a F(g)F(h) = ag_\xi \sigma_{F,g} F(h) = g_{\xi&apos;} g^*a \sigma_{F,g} F(h) \\
= G(g) \circ \sigma_{G,g}^{-1} g^*a \sigma_{F,g} F(h).
\end{gather*}\]

&lt;p&gt;The argument is summarized in the following rather pretty commutative diagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/cfgdiagram.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;The argument above summarized in diagram form&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It follows by properties of categories fibered in groupoids that the naturality square commutes.
This proves that \(\operatorname{よ}\) is full.
In fact it is faithful as well, since the arrow \(\alpha(Y)\) 
is uniquely determined by \(Y\) (really \(f\colon Y \to X\)) and \(a\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To complete the proof, we show essential surjectivity.
Suppose \(\xi\) is an object over \(X\) in \(\mathsf{D}\).
We need to show that there is a functor \(F \colon \underline{X} \to \mathsf{D}\)
and an isomorphism \(\xi \to \operatorname{よ}(F) = F(X)\).
We will do one better:
define \(F(X) = \xi\) and given a map \(f\colon Y \to X\), define \(F(Y) = f^*\xi\).
Given an arrow \(h \colon Y \to Z\) over \(X\), (where again we have \(g\colon Z \to X\))
there is by the definition of a category fibered in groupoids
a unique arrow \(F(h) \colon f^*\xi \to g^*\xi\)
making the following diagram commute&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
f^*\xi @&amp;gt;f_\xi&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi \\
@VF(h)VV @| \\
g^*\xi @&amp;gt;g_\xi&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;over the map \(h\colon Y \to Z\).
Functoriality of \(F\) follows by uniqueness.
Thus \(\xi\) is &lt;em&gt;equal&lt;/em&gt; to the image of \(1_X\colon X \to X\) under some functor,
hence certainly isomorphic to it. \(\blacksquare\)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">In the previous two posts we met stacks for the first time.

The stacks we’re interested in are &lt;em&gt;geometric&lt;/em&gt; stacks, so this won’t be the last post on stacks,
but with any luck we’ll see the definition in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let \(\mathsf{C}\) be a category fibered in groupoids over \(\mathbf{Top}\).
We say an object \(\xi \in \mathsf{C}\) is &lt;em&gt;over&lt;/em&gt; a space \(X\)
if \(\pi(\xi) = X\).
Both Lerman and Fantechi adopt the following convention:
for every continuous map \(f\colon Y \to X\) and every object \(\xi\) over \(X\),
we choose a lift \(f_\xi \colon f^*\xi \to \xi\)
that we call “the” pullback of \(\xi\) along \(f\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that if we had another choice \(f&apos;\colon \xi&apos; \to \xi\) of pullback,
then in \(\mathbf{Top}\) we have the following rather silly commutative diagram&lt;/p&gt;

\[\require{AMScd}\begin{CD}
Y @&amp;gt;f&amp;gt;&amp;gt; X \\
@| @| \\
Y @&amp;gt;f&amp;gt;&amp;gt; X,
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;so by the second item in the definition of a category fibered in groupoids,
there are unique maps \(g\colon f^*\xi \to \xi&apos;\) and \(g&apos;\colon \xi&apos; \to f^*\xi\)
such that, for example, the following diagram commutes&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
f^*\xi @&amp;gt;f_\xi&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi \\
@VgVV @| \\
\xi&apos; @&amp;gt;f&apos;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi.
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;It’s not hard to see that \(g\) and \(g&apos;\) are therefore inverse isomorphisms.
By the way, if \(f\) is the identity of \(X\), we see that this argument implies that
the category of objects above \(X\) is a groupoid: every arrow is an isomorphism.
Hence the name, I suppose.
In fact, if \(f\colon Y \to X\) is a continuous map
and \(\alpha\colon \xi \to \xi&apos;\) is an arrow (necessarily an isomorphism)
of objects over \(X\), a clever application of the second item again shows that
there is a unique isomorphism \(f^*\alpha\colon f^*\xi \to f^*\xi&apos;\)
such that the following diagram commutes&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
f^*\xi @&amp;gt;f_\xi&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi \\
@VVf^*\alpha V @VV\alpha V \\
f^*\xi&apos; @&amp;gt;f_{\xi&apos;}&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi&apos;.
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;Notice as well that we do not require (and probably cannot in general)
that \(g^*f^*\xi = (fg)^*\xi\), merely that they are canonically isomorphic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;descent-data&quot;&gt;Descent data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of descent is that given, say, a vector bundle defined 
open set by open set on a space \(X\)
satisfying certain gluing conditions,
this data &lt;em&gt;descends&lt;/em&gt; to a vector bundle on \(X\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More formally, let \(\mathcal{U} = \{U_i\}_{i\in I}\) be an open cover of \(X\),
and for each \(i\), let \(\iota_i \colon U_i \to X\) be the inclusion.
We have inclusions \(\iota_{ji}\colon (U_j \cap U_i) \to U_j\)
and \(\iota_{ij}\colon (U_j \cap U_i) \to U_i\) for each double intersection
and \(\iota^i_{ijk}\), \(\iota^j_{ijk}\) and \(\iota^k_{ijk}\) for inclusions from the triple
intersection \(U_i \cap U_j \cap U_k\) to the various double intersections,
where the superscript indicates the omitted subscript in the target of the inclusion.
A &lt;em&gt;descent datum&lt;/em&gt; for \(\mathsf{C}\) over \(X\) is the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An object \(\xi_i\) over \(U_i\) for each \(i\).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For each pair \(i\) and \(j\), an isomorphism 
\(\alpha_{ji} \colon \iota_{ij}^*\xi_i \to \iota_{ji}^*\xi_j\)
in the fiber over \(U_i \cap U_j\).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The isomorphisms above satisfy the &lt;em&gt;cocycle condition&lt;/em&gt;
(so named for reasons of Čech cohomology probably, so way over my head)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

\[(\iota_{ijk}^j)^*\alpha_{ki} = (\iota_{ijk}^i)^*\alpha_{kj} \circ (\iota_{ijk}^k)^*\alpha_{ji}\]

&lt;p&gt;The descent datum is &lt;em&gt;effective&lt;/em&gt; if there exists an object \(\xi\) over \(X\)
with isomorphisms \(\alpha_i \colon \iota_i^*\xi \to \xi_i\) in the fiber over \(U_i\)
with the property that \(\alpha_{ji} = \iota_{ji}^*\alpha_j\circ (\iota_{ij}^*\alpha_i)^{-1}\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In plainer words, a &lt;em&gt;descent datum&lt;/em&gt; is that open set by open set construction 
of something you’d like to exist in \(\mathsf{C}\),
and saying that the descent datum is &lt;em&gt;effective&lt;/em&gt; says that the wished-for object really exists
and is moreover obtained by gluing together it patch by patch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we say that &lt;em&gt;isomorphisms are a sheaf&lt;/em&gt; for \(\mathsf{C}\) if,
roughly, isomorphisms between elements of \(\mathsf{C}\) over any space \(X\)
are determined uniquely by their restriction to any open cover of \(X\).
More formally,
we require that for any space \(X\), 
every pair of objects \(\xi\) and \(\xi&apos;\) in the fiber over \(X\),
every open cover \(\{U_i\}_{i \in I}\) of \(X\)
and every collection of isomorphisms \(\alpha_i\colon \iota_i^*\xi \to \iota_i^*\xi&apos;\)
with the property that \(\iota_{ij}^*\alpha_i = \iota_{ji}^*\alpha_j\)
on \(U_i \cap U_j\),
there exists a unique isomorphism \(\alpha\colon \xi \to \xi&apos;\)
such that \(\iota_i^*\alpha = \alpha_i\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our category fibered in groupoids \(\mathsf{C}\) is a &lt;em&gt;stack&lt;/em&gt;
if isomorphisms are a sheaf and every descent datum is effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A map of stacks \(\mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{D}\) over \(\mathbf{Top}\) is a functor
\(F\colon \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{D}\) with the property that
\(\pi F = \pi\), where we abuse notation by writing both \(\pi\colon \mathsf{C} \to \mathbf{Top}\)
and \(\pi\colon \mathsf{D} \to \mathbf{Top}\).
A &lt;em&gt;natural transformation&lt;/em&gt; of maps \(F\), \(G\colon \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{D}\)
is a natural transformation \(\eta\colon F \Rightarrow G\)
with the property that for each \(\xi \in \mathsf{C}\),
we have \(\pi(\eta_\xi) = 1_{\pi(\xi)}\).
Notice that because \(F\xi\) and \(G\xi\) are in the fiber over \(\pi(\xi)\),
the map \(\eta_\xi\) is automatically an isomorphism,
so all natural transformations are natural isomorphisms.
An &lt;em&gt;isomorphism&lt;/em&gt; of stacks is an equivalence of categories over \(\mathbf{Top}\),
i.e. \(F\colon \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{D}\) is full, faithful and essentially surjective.
Since we love the &lt;a href=&quot;/2020/08/02/The-Axiom-of-Choice-is-False-for-Manifolds.html&quot;&gt;axiom of choice&lt;/a&gt; around here,
this is equivalent to the existence of an inverse functor up to natural isomorphism.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">A stack, so I’m told, is a category fibered in groupoids satisfying some extra conditions.

and orbifolds as (being represented by) étale groupoids.
In view of &lt;a href=&quot;/2022/05/15/More-Maps-Lerman&apos;s-Critique.html&quot;&gt;Lerman’s critique&lt;/a&gt;, to which his answer is the category of geometric stacks over manifolds,
I thought it might be relevant to try and understand what a stack is.
This is the first in what will likely be several posts towards understanding the definition of a stack;
this one is focused on the concept of a &lt;em&gt;category fibered in groupoids.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;categories-fibered-in-groupoids&quot;&gt;Categories fibered in groupoids&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let \(\mathbf{Top}\) denote the category of compactly generated topological spaces and continuous maps.
(All spaces I tend to think about are compactly generated, being either manifolds or CW complexes,
so this is not a serious restriction for me.
That being said, I don’t immediately understand the desire to restrict to compactly generated spaces,
because my algebraic topology is not strong in that direction.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A functor \(\pi \colon \mathsf{C} \to \mathbf{Top}\) 
is a &lt;em&gt;category fibered in groupoids over \(\mathbf{Top}\)&lt;/em&gt;
if the following conditions hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Given a continuous map \(f\colon X \to Y\) and an object \(\xi \in \mathsf{C}\)
  with \(\pi(\xi) = Y\),
  there is an arrow \(\tilde f \colon \zeta \to \xi\) in \(\mathsf{C}\) such that
  \(\pi(\tilde f) = f\).
  Apparently we are supposed to think of \(\zeta\) as a &lt;em&gt;pullback&lt;/em&gt; of \(\xi\) along \(f\).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Given a diagram of the following form&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

\[\require{AMScd}\begin{CD}
        \xi&apos;&apos; @&amp;gt;f&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi \\
        @. @| \\
        \xi&apos; @&amp;gt;h&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \xi
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;in \(\mathsf{C}\) such that there exists a continuous map \(g\colon \pi(\xi&apos;&apos;) \to \pi(\xi&apos;)\)
making the following diagram commute&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
    \pi(\xi&apos;&apos;) @&amp;gt;\pi(f)&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \pi(\xi) \\
    @VgVV @| \\
    \pi(\xi&apos;) @&amp;gt;\pi(h)&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \pi(\xi),
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;There exists a unique arrow \(\tilde g\colon \xi&apos;&apos; \to \xi&apos;\)
such that \(h\tilde g = f\) and \(\pi(\tilde g) = g\).
In other words, there is a unique way to lift the map \(g\) to make the diagram commute in \(\mathsf{C}\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In understanding stacks, I’m trying to follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://ems.press/content/serial-article-files/6839&quot;&gt;Lerman’s paper&lt;/a&gt; 
and also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/~rehmann/ECM/cdrom/3ecm/pdfs/pant3/fantechi.pdf&quot;&gt;Fantechi’s survey paper&lt;/a&gt;, so there are two main examples:
Lerman gives the example of the category \(\mathsf{B}\mathcal{G}\) of principal \(\mathcal{G}\)-bundles
with arrows \(\mathcal{G}\)-equivariant maps.
Fantechi gives the example of vector bundles of rank \(r\) and bundle isomorphisms.
I’ll give Fantechi’s example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;example-vector-bundles-of-constant-rank&quot;&gt;Example: Vector bundles of constant rank&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall that a &lt;em&gt;vector bundle of rank \(r\)&lt;/em&gt; over a topological space \(X\)
is a space \(E\) equipped with a continuous surjection \(\pi\colon E \to X\)
such that for each point \(x \in X\), the space \(\pi^{-1}(x)\) is a real vector space of dimension \(r\)
and such that for each \(x \in X\), there exists an open neighborhood \(U\) of \(x\)
and a homeomorphism \(\varphi\cong U\times \mathbb{R}^r \to \pi^{-1}(U)\)
with the property that \(\pi\varphi(y,\vec v) = y\)
and the property that the map \(\vec v \mapsto \varphi(y,\vec v)\) is a linear isomorphism
from \(\mathbb{R}^r\) to \(\pi^{-1}(y)\)
for all \(y \in U\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a category \(\mathsf{Vect}_r\) of rank-\(r\) vector bundles
where the arrows are &lt;em&gt;vector bundle maps of rank \(r\):&lt;/em&gt; commutative diagrams of the form&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
E_1 @&amp;gt;\tilde f&amp;gt;&amp;gt; E_2 \\
@VV\pi_1V @VV\pi_2V \\
X_1 @&amp;gt;f&amp;gt;&amp;gt; X_2
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;with the property that each map \(\pi_1^{-1}(x) \to \pi_2^{-1}(f(x))\) is a linear isomorphism of vector spaces.
We will abuse notation, writing \(\tilde f\colon E_1 \to E_2\) to mean the bundle map above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The claim is that the functor (also called \(\pi\)) 
sending a rank-\(r\) vector bundle \(\pi\colon E \to X\) to its base \(X\)
defines a category fibered in groupoids over \(\mathbf{Top}\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see this, suppose that \(\pi\colon E \to X\) is a vector bundle and \(f\colon Y \to X\) is a continuous map.
We need a pullback \(\tilde f \colon \xi \to E\) for some vector bundle \(\xi\) over \(Y\).
Let us take the literal pullback, that is,&lt;/p&gt;

\[\xi = \{ (y,e) \in Y \times E : f(y) = \pi(e) \}\]

&lt;p&gt;There is an obvious projection \(\pi\colon \xi \to Y\) given by projection to the first factor.
Given \(x \in X\), let \(U\) be the neighborhood of \(x\) 
with the homeomorphism \(\varphi \colon U \times \mathbb{R}^r \to \pi^{-1}(U)\).
Write \(V = f^{-1}(U)\) and define
\(\psi\colon V \times \mathbb{R}^r \to \pi^{-1}(V)\) by the rule&lt;/p&gt;

\[\psi(y,\vec v) = (y,(\varphi(f(y),\vec v)).\]

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that \(\pi\psi(y,\vec v) = y\) for all \(y \in V\).
Conversely, given \((y,e) \in \pi^{-1}(V)\), note that \(\varphi^{-1}(e) = (f(y),\vec v)\) 
for some \(\vec v \in \mathbb{R}^r\);
put another way, the map \((y,e) \mapsto (y,\vec v)\), where \(\vec v\) is the \(\mathbb{R}^r\) component
of \(\varphi^{-1}(e)\), is an inverse homeomorphism for \(\psi\).
The map \(\vec v \mapsto \psi(y,\vec v)\) is a linear isomorphism because \(\vec v \mapsto \varphi(f(y),\vec v)\)
is a linear isomorphism.
Therefore \(\xi\) is a rank-\(r\) vector bundle over \(Y\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a map \(\tilde f \colon \xi \to E\) given by projection to the second factor.
The map \(\pi^{-1}(y) \to \pi^{-1}(f(y))\) given by \((y, e) \mapsto e\) is a linear isomorphism.
To see this, note that we have the following commutative diagram&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
\pi^{-1}(y) @&amp;gt;f&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \pi^{-1}(f(y)) \\
@A\psi AA @A\varphi AA \\
\mathbb{R}^r @= \mathbb{R}^r
\end{CD}
\qquad
\begin{CD}
\psi(y,\vec v) @&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \varphi(f(y),\vec v) \\
@AAA @AAA \\
\vec v @= \vec v
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;and the vertical maps are isomorphisms.
Therefore the map \(\tilde f\colon \xi \to E\) is an arrow of \(\mathsf{Vect}_r\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given maps of vector bundles \(\tilde f\colon \xi&apos;&apos; \to \xi\) and \(\tilde h\colon \xi&apos; \to \xi\)
such that there exists a continuous map \(g \colon \pi(\xi&apos;&apos;) \to \pi(x&apos;)\) making the following diagram commute&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
\pi(\xi&apos;&apos;) @&amp;gt;f&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \pi(\xi) \\
@VVgV @| \\
\pi(\xi&apos;) @&amp;gt;h&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \pi(\xi),
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;we claim that there is a unique bundle map \(\tilde g\colon \xi&apos;&apos; \to \xi&apos;\) making the appropriate diagram commute.
Given \(x \in \pi(\xi&apos;&apos;)\), note that \(\tilde f\) and \(\tilde g\)
induce linear isomorphisms \(\pi^{-1}(x) \to \pi^{-1}(f(x))\) and 
\(\pi^{-1}(g(x)) \to \pi^{-1}(hg(x)) = \pi^{-1}(f(x))\).
Call these isomorphisms \(f_x\) and \(h_{g(x)}\).
Therefore define \(\tilde g\) as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\(\tilde g(\tilde x) = h_{g(\pi(\tilde x))}^{-1}f_{\pi(\tilde x)}(\tilde x)\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that \(\tilde g\) is a bundle map making the relevant diagram commute
and that conversely \(\tilde g\) is the only definition we could have made.
Therefore \(\mathsf{Vect}_r\) defines a category fibered in groupoids over \(\mathbf{Top}\).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’ve spent the past couple years on and off understanding how to think of graphs of groups and orbifolds as (being represented by) étale groupoids.
