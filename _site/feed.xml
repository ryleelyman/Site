I collaborate with other mathematicians on papers.
I’ve used Overleaf, emailing the paper back and forth,
and taking turns in Dropbox as my mode of collaboration.
I &lt;em&gt;haven’t&lt;/em&gt; collaborated using Git, but I sure would like to.
The purpose of this post is for mathematicians
like for example my younger self,
who are familiar with the command line
and curious about Git as a tool,
and for whatever reason don’t have the patience for something like “Git for Poets.”
I explain Git just enough to get you started on a simple project,
and hopefully enough so that you can start
Googling things you’re unfamiliar with.
I’m not an expert, and I expect my inexpertise to show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start. There are two ways I typically start.
The first way is 
that I have files on my computer that I would like to use Git on.
So I would open a command line,
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; over to where those files are (say &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/Documents/waver&lt;/code&gt;) and invoke
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git init&lt;/code&gt;.
This starts a new Git repository in the folder you’re in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other way is some Git repository already exists
(probably on GitHub)
and I would like to work on those files.
In that case I would find the URL of that repository,
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; to the directory where I would like to put my copy of the repository,
and invoke
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git clone &amp;lt;url&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
This automatically creates a new folder with the contents of the repository,
so if I was cloning &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ryleelyman/waver&lt;/code&gt; on GitHub, for instance,
and I wanted it to end up in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/Documents/waver&lt;/code&gt;,
I would run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git clone https://github.com/ryleelyman/waver.git&lt;/code&gt; 
in my &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/Documents&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Git is paying attention to the files in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/Documents/waver&lt;/code&gt;,
but by default it isn’t doing anything to them at all.
You can see what it thinks by invoking &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git status&lt;/code&gt;.
If you have files that have changed,
Git will display them (in red, in my terminal).
For example, when I run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git status&lt;/code&gt; in the
directory for my website, it tells me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Changes not staged for commit:
  (use &quot;git add &amp;lt;file&amp;gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
  (use &quot;git restore &amp;lt;file&amp;gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   _site/blog.html
        modified:   _site/feed.xml
        modified:   _site/sitemap.xml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Git tracks changes based on “commits,”
but in order for something to be committed
Git needs to know that you want to commit it.
That’s the business of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git add &amp;lt;file&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; comment above.
If we were to do &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git add _site/blog.html&lt;/code&gt;,
we would be telling Git to prepare to commit
the changes we made to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_site/blog.html&lt;/code&gt; file.
To actually commit the changes from there we would do
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git commit&lt;/code&gt;.
But! Don’t actually do &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git commit&lt;/code&gt;.
I prefer &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git commit -m &quot;&amp;lt;message&amp;gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.
Git commits require a little blurb from you about the changes,
and I find it much more convenient to just write that message
on the command line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Git knows about our changes locally.
If we’re working with a remote repository, say on GitHub,
we still need to update that repository.
To do that we invoke &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt;.
If you started the repository with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git init&lt;/code&gt;,
you may need to setup GitHub (or whatever it is)
to track the repository you created. 
GitHub has nice instructions for this.
To update our local repository with changes from the remote repository,
we would do &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are all the commands I use daily.
I didn’t talk about Gits “branching” model,
which is worth learning a bit about.
I don’t know that I have anything cogent to say about it,
so maybe I’ll stop here.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">As a mathematician, I collaborate with other mathematicians on papers.

hyperbolic metric space might still have locally compact Gromov boundary.
I was particularly interested in the case of a simplicial tree
equipped with the path metric where each edge has length \(1\)
with some vertices of infinite valence.
The answer in this case is &lt;em&gt;no.&lt;/em&gt;
Instead, the boundary of such a tree is homeomorphic to the &lt;em&gt;Baire space&lt;/em&gt; \(\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}\).
In this post I’ll talk through why this is the case.
There is also a notion of a &lt;em&gt;Bowditch boundary&lt;/em&gt; for a tree with vertices of infinite valence.
I’d like to show that the Bowditch boundary of such a tree is a Cantor set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trees we are interested in are Bass–Serre trees associated to free splittings of countable groups
with the property that some vertex group is infinite.
Let \(T\) be such a tree.
Then \(T\) admits a cocompact group action, has countably infinitely many edges
and has a vertex of countably infinite valence.
We can give \(T\) the structure of a metric space by considering the path metric
where each edge is assigned length \(1\).
The “identity map” from \(T\) as a simplicial complex to \(T\) as a metric space
is continuous, but its inverse is not.
The property that \(T\) admits a cocompact group action
implies that any geodesic ray (isometric embedding of \(\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}\))
passes through infinitely many vertices of infinite valence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-gromov-boundary-of-t&quot;&gt;The Gromov boundary of \(T\)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fix a point \(p\) in \(T\).
The Gromov boundary \(\partial_\infty T\) of \(T\) is the set of geodesic rays in \(T\) beginning at \(p\).
(It turns out that the Gromov boundary is independent of the choice of basepoint.)
Let \(J\) be a (finite) geodesic segment in \(T\) beginning at \(p\).
A basic open set \(U_J\) for the topology on \(\partial_\infty T\)
is given by the set of geodesic rays that contain \(J\) as a subpath.
I’ll leave it to show you that the intersection of basic open sets is either empty or another basic open set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-baire-space&quot;&gt;The Baire space&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Baire space \(\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}\) is homeomorphic to the irrational numbers.
A theorem of Alexandrov and Urysohn says that
the Baire space is characterized up to homeomorphism by the following properties.
It is a (nonempty) &lt;em&gt;Polish space,&lt;/em&gt; meaning it is &lt;em&gt;separable&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;completely metrizable.&lt;/em&gt;
It is &lt;em&gt;zero-dimensional,&lt;/em&gt; meaning it has a basis of clopen sets.
Finally, every compact subset has empty interior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To show that the Gromov boundary of \(T\) is homeomorphic to the Baire space,
we will verify these properties.
It is completely metrizable by general theory.
There are countably infinitely many finite geodesic segments in \(T\) beginning at \(p\)
(one for each vertex of \(T\)),
so \(\partial_\infty T\) is second countable, and in particular separable.
A basic closed set of \(\partial_\infty T\) is given by the set of those geodesic rays
that do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; contain a geodesic segment \(J\) as a subpath.
It’s not hard to find a collection of geodesic segments such that any geodesic ray
that does not contain any of these geodesic segments as a subpath must contain \(J\) as a subpath.
I’ll leave the details to you.
Therefore \(\partial_\infty T\) has a basis of clopen sets.
To show that every compact subset has empty interior,
it suffices to show that our basic clopen sets are never compact.
To see this, continue \(J\) until you reach a vertex of infinite valence,
giving us a new finite geodesic segment \(J&apos;\).
Write \(U_J \setminus U_{J&apos;}\) as a finite disjoint union of basic open sets,
and \(U_{J&apos;}\) as the infinite disjoint union of the \(U_{J&apos;&apos;}\),
where \(J&apos;&apos;\) is one edge longer than \(J&apos;\).
The result is an open cover of \(U_J\) with no finite subcover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bowditch-boundary&quot;&gt;The Bowditch boundary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Bowditch boundary&lt;/em&gt; of \(T\) is the set \(\partial T = \partial_\infty T \cup V_\infty(T)\),
where \(V_\infty(T)\) denotes the set of vertices of \(T\) with infinite valence.
The Bowditch boundary carries with it the &lt;em&gt;observer’s topology,&lt;/em&gt; which we now describe.
Given two points \(q\) and \(r\) in \(T\), the &lt;em&gt;direction of \(r\) at \(q\)&lt;/em&gt; is the component of \(T\setminus \{q\}\)
that contains \(r\).
We continue to think of points of \(\partial_\infty T\) as geodesic rays based at \(p\);
for convenience suppose that \(p\) is either in the interior of an edge or a vertex with finite valence.
We may additionally think of a point \(v \in V_\infty(T)\)
as being represented by the geodesic segment from \(p\) to \(v\).
We say that a point of \(\partial T\) belongs to a direction if the
corresponding geodesic starting at \(p\) is contained in the direction.
The set of directions in \(T\) forms a subbasis for the observer’s topology on \(\partial T\);
thus a basic open set is given by a finite intersection of directions of \(T\).
Put another way, a basic open set is given by the set of those geodesics based at \(p\)
that avoid a given finite subset of \(T\).
We can always take this finite set to be a set of vertices or midpoints of edges,
so the observer’s topology is second countable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d like to show that the Bowditch boundary of \(T\) is a Cantor set.
It is clear that \(\partial T\) has no isolated points.
It is compact and Hausdorff by general theory.
Thus it suffices to show that our basis elements are clopen.
We will show that our open basic open sets are compact.
Indeed, let \(U\) be a basic open set determined by the finite set of points \(\{z_1,\dotsc,z_n\} \subset T\),
and let \(\{U_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha\in I}\) be an open cover of \(U\) by basic open sets,
which are determined by finite sets of points containing \(\{z_1,\dotsc, z_n\}\) as a subset.
Take \(U_\alpha \in I\).
Then there are finitely many points \(z_{n+1},\dotsc,z_{n+k}\) determining \(U_\alpha\) and contained in \(U\).
For each \(z_{n+i}\) for \(i\) satisfying \(1 \le i \le k\), we can find \(\alpha_i \in I\)
such that \(U_{\alpha_i}\) contains \(z_{n+i}\).
Then \(U_\alpha,U_{\alpha_1},\dotsc,U_{\alpha_k}\) is a finite subcover of \(U\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-parallel-example&quot;&gt;A parallel example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the Cantor space be \(\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{N}}\).
The subspace of sequences which are eventually constant is countable and dense.
The subspace of sequences which are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; eventually constant is
&lt;a href=&quot;https://math.stackexchange.com/a/254381/447318&quot;&gt;homeomorphic to the Baire space&lt;/a&gt;.
This is more or less what is happening here: we add countably many points to
our non-locally compact Gromov boundary to get the compact Bowditch boundary.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The other day on Twitter I asked whether it might be the case that a non-proper hyperbolic metric space might still have locally compact Gromov boundary.

The word “proved” is in quotes because actually there was nothing to prove,
I just happened to be primed to notice that all the conditions were already there.
The purpose of this post is to tell you the story of how this came to be
and give the sketch of the proof that requires zero input from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the story.
The first full week of July,
I attended &lt;a href=&quot;https://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/~masmbe/Charney/&quot;&gt;Ruth Charney’s birthday conference&lt;/a&gt;.
It was wonderful to be around people doing math in person again!
At this conference, Mladen Bestvina gave a talk about the Farrell–Jones conjecture
for (virtually torsion-free) hyperbolic-by-cyclic groups.
I don’t fully understand the statement of the conjecture,
which says that certain assembly maps (?) in \(K\)-theory (??) or \(L\)-theory (???) are isomorphisms.
However, I did learn a useful tool for proving the Farrell–Jones conjecture,
a relatively recent (as in 2017) theorem due to Knopf:
if a (countable) group \(G\) acts acylindrically (without inversions) on a (simplicial) tree 
and the vertex stabilizers satisfy the Farrell–Jones conjecture, then so does \(G\).
Here &lt;em&gt;acylindrically&lt;/em&gt; means that there exists \(K \ge 0\) such that the stabilizer
of any geodesic segment of length \(K\) is finite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I worked on this past week after coming back was my first review for zbMath.
The paper I reviewed studied high-dimensional graph manifolds,
which were introduced by Figerio, Lafont and Sisto.
A high-dimensional graph manifold is made of &lt;em&gt;pieces,&lt;/em&gt;
each piece is a product of a torus and
a finite-volume hyperbolic manifold with toric cusps,
and the pieces are glued together by cutting off the cusps
into torus boundary components and gluing the tori.
As such, the fundamental group of a high-dimensional graph manifold is naturally
the fundamental group of a graph of groups
whose vertex groups are the pieces and whose edge groups are \(\mathbb{Z}^{n-1}\).
Figerio, Lafont and Sisto prove that the high-dimensional graph manifold is
what’s called &lt;em&gt;irreducible&lt;/em&gt; if and only if the action of the fundamental group
on the Bass–Serre tree for the graph of groups is acylindrical (in fact, you can take \(K\) to be \(3\)).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since CAT(0) groups (in particular, the fundamental groups of the pieces)
satisfy the Farrell–Jones conjecture,
the theorem above implies that irreducible high-dimensional graph manifold groups
satisfy the Farrell–Jones conjecture!
Not bad for no real work, eh?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The other day I “proved” the Farrell–Jones conjecture for a family of groups.

However, it is only a quasi-isometry invariant for geodesic metric spaces.
I learned this from a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0723086905000113?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;paper of Väisälä&lt;/a&gt;.
The purpose of this post is to understand the counterexample he gives.
I also define Gromov hyperbolicity and quasi-isometry in this post,
which might make it useful for future reference.
The reader already familiar with Gromov hyperbolicity and quasi-isometries
might wish to skip ahead to the heading below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let \((X,d)\) be a metric space.
We say that \(X\) is a &lt;em&gt;length space&lt;/em&gt; if the distance between any two points \(x\) and \(y\) in \(X\)
is equal to the infimum of the length of a path joining them.
A &lt;em&gt;geodesic&lt;/em&gt; in \(X\) is a path \(\gamma\colon [a,b] \to X\) from a closed interval \([a,b] \subset \mathbb{R}\)
such that \(d(\gamma(s),\gamma(t)) = |s-t|\) for all \(s\) and \(t\) in the interval \([a,b]\).
We say that \(X\) is a &lt;em&gt;geodesic&lt;/em&gt; metric space if any two points can be joined by a geodesic.
Geodesic metric spaces are length spaces but not necessarily conversely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gromov’s original definition of hyperbolicity of \(X\) is the following.
Given points \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\) in \(X\), define the &lt;em&gt;Gromov product&lt;/em&gt;
of \(x\) and \(y\) with respect to \(z\) to be the quantity&lt;/p&gt;

\[(x,y)_z = \frac{1}{2}\left(d(x,z) + d(y,z) - d(x,y)\right).\]

&lt;p&gt;Then we say that \(X\) is &lt;em&gt;\(\delta\)-hyperbolic&lt;/em&gt; if there exists some \(\delta \ge 0\)
with the property that for any four points \(x\), \(y\), \(z\) and \(w\) in \(X\),
we have&lt;/p&gt;

\[(x,z)_w \ge \min\{(x,y)_w,(y,z)_w\} - \delta.\]

&lt;p&gt;Let’s try and make sense of this.
The intuition for the Gromov product is the following.
A &lt;em&gt;tripod&lt;/em&gt; is a metric tree with four vertices, three of which are leaves and one of which has valence three.
Given any triple of points \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\) in a metric space,
you should convince yourself that we can always construct a tripod
with leaves \(\hat x\), \(\hat y\) and \(\hat z\) such that we have&lt;/p&gt;

\[d(x,y) = d(\hat x,\hat y),\quad d(x,z) = d(\hat x,\hat z),\quad\text{and}\quad d(y,z) = d(\hat y,\hat z).\]

&lt;p&gt;In this situation, the Gromov product \((x,y)_z\)
is equal to the distance from \(\hat z\) to the center vertex of the tripod.
To make sense of the hyperbolicity condition,
let’s continue to think about trees,
only in this case assume that \(X\) itself is a metric tree.
Then in this case it’s not too hard to argue that the hyperbolicity condition holds with \(\delta = 0\);
a picture illustrating the general case is below.
Thus one way to think of \(\delta\)-hyperbolicity is to think that from the point of view of any point \(w \in X\),
triangles in \(X\) look like triangles in trees, up to an error of \(\delta\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/GromovProduct.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Trees are $$0$$-hyperbolic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If \(X\) is a geodesic metric space, there are other conditions equivalent to this one
that are more directly about the geometry of, e.g. triangles in \(X\).
I’ve been collecting as many of these conditions as the community will give me
in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://mathoverflow.net/q/396359/135175&quot;&gt;MathOverflow post&lt;/a&gt;.
Eventually I expect to make a blog post or several about the various definitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given metric spaces \((X,d_X)\) and \((Y,d_Y)\) and constants \(K \ge 1\) and \(C \ge 0\),
a &lt;em&gt;\((K,C)\)-quasi-isometric embedding&lt;/em&gt; is a function \(f\colon X \to Y\)
(it need not be continuous)
such that for all points \(x\) and \(y\) in \(X\), the following inequality holds&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac 1Kd_X(x,y) - C \le d_Y(f(x),f(y)) \le Kd_X(x,y) + C.\]

&lt;p&gt;So we see that \(f\) is allowed to distort distances by a bounded multiplicative and additive amount.
A &lt;em&gt;\((K,C)\)-quasi-isometry&lt;/em&gt; is a \((K,C)\)-quasi-isometric embedding with the additional property that
for every point \(y \in Y\) there is a point \(x \in X\) such that \(d_Y(y,f(x)) \le C\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-theorem-and-the-counterexample&quot;&gt;The theorem and the counterexample&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Väisälä proves the following theorem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem&lt;/strong&gt; Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be length spaces and \(f\colon X \to Y\) a quasi-isometric embedding.
If \(Y\) is \(\delta\)-hyperbolic, then \(X\) is \(\delta&apos;\)-hyperbolic
for some \(\delta&apos;\) depending only on \(\delta\) and the quasi-isometry constants for \(f\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then observes that the theorem is not true if one does not assume that \(X\) is a length space.
Here is the counterexample.
The hyperbolic space \(Y\) is the real line \(\mathbb{R}\) with the standard metric.
(Recall that \(\mathbb{R}\) is a real tree, and thus \(0\)-hyperbolic.)
The space \(X\) is the graph of the absolute value function \(\{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : y = |x| \}\)
with the Euclidean metric.
The claim is that the map \(f\colon X \to Y\) defined as \(f(x,y) = x\) is a quasi-isometric embedding,
but that \(X\) is not hyperbolic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we show that \(f\) is a quasi-isometric embedding.
Indeed, it is clear that given \(\vec x\) and \(\vec y\) in \(X\),
we have \(d_Y(f(\vec x),f(\vec y)) \le d_X(\vec x,\vec y)\).
On the other hand, note that \(d_X(\vec x,\vec y)\) is furthest from \(d_Y(f(\vec x),f(\vec y))\)
when \(\vec x\) and \(\vec y\) are in the same quadrant, where we have
\(d_X(\vec x,\vec y) = \sqrt{2}d_Y(f(\vec x),f(\vec y))\).
Thus the map \(f\) is a \((\sqrt 2,0)\)-quasi-isometric embedding, in fact a \((\sqrt 2,0)\)-quasi-isometry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we show that \(X\) is not hyperbolic.
Consider the four points \(x = (0,0)\), \(y = (-2t,2t)\), \(z = (2t,2t)\) and \(w = (t,t)\).
Then we have&lt;/p&gt;

\[(x,z)_w = \frac 12\left(\sqrt 2t + \sqrt 2t - 2\sqrt 2t\right) = 0,\]

\[(x,y)_w = \frac 12\left(\sqrt 2t + 2\sqrt 5t - 2\sqrt 2t\right) \approx 1.53t\]

\[(y,z)_w = \frac 12\left(2\sqrt 5t + \sqrt 2t - 4t\right) \approx 0.94t\]

&lt;p&gt;But observe that as \(t \to \infty\), we have that \((x,y)_w\) and \((y,z)_w\) tend to \(\infty\),
so no uniform choice of \(\delta\) makes the inequality
\((x,z)_w \ge \min\{(x,y)_w,(y,z)_w\} - \delta\) hold.
The problem, roughly, is that the quasi-isometry condition cannot see the “kink” in the space \(X\),
while the \(\delta\)-hyperbolicity condition, at least for this family of triangles, can.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Gromov’s original definition of Gromov hyperbolicity makes sense for arbitrary metric spaces.

The purpose of this post is introduce the Farey graph

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/FareyGraph.png&quot; alt=&quot;The first four layer of the Farey graph&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Farey graph has as vertices all rational numbers
expressed as fractions \(\frac{p}{q}\) in lowest terms with \(q \ge 0\),
together with a vertex for \(\frac{1}{0}\).
Two vertices \(\frac{a}{b}\) and \(\frac{c}{d}\) span an edge
when the matrix \(\begin{pmatrix} a &amp;amp; c \\ b &amp;amp; d \end{pmatrix}\) has determinant \(\pm 1\).
Above is a picture; thanks to StackExchange user &lt;a href=&quot;https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/165845/212812&quot;&gt;marchetto&lt;/a&gt;
for the TikZ code for producing the Farey diagram, to which I mainly added numbers.
I’d like to demonstrate that the visual properties of the Farey graph hold:
namely, that every edge belongs to exactly two triangles,
and that edges do not cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;edges-belong-to-two-triangles&quot;&gt;Edges belong to two triangles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section we will show that every edge of the Farey graph belongs to two triangles.
The key tool will be a lemma I learned from
&lt;a href=&quot;http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/TN/TNch1.pdf&quot;&gt;Allen Hatcher’s &lt;em&gt;Topology of Numbers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lemma.&lt;/strong&gt; Suppose \(a\) and \(b\) are integers with no common divisor.
If one integral solution of \(ay - bx = n\) is \((x,y) = (c,d)\),
then the general integral solution is \((x,y) = (c + ka, d + kb)\) for integer \(k\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proof.&lt;/em&gt; Consider a general solution \((x,y)\).
Given our known solution \((c,d)\), we see that \(a(y-d) - b(x -c) = n - n = 0\).
Since \(a\) and \(b\) have no common factors, it follows that \(a\) divides \(x-c\) and \(b\) divides \(y-d\).
In fact, we have \(a(y-d) = abk = b(x-c)\), from which the result follows. \(\blacksquare\)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variant on the proof shows that if \(ac - bd = -n\), then the general integral solution for
\(ax - by = n\) is \((ka - c,kb - d)\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proposition.&lt;/strong&gt; Suppose that \(\frac ab\) and \(\frac cd\) are in the Farey graph,
and that \(ad &amp;gt; bc\). If \(\frac xy\) is adjacent to both \(\frac ab\) and \(\frac bc\),
then \(\frac xy = \frac{a\pm c}{b\pm d}\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proof.&lt;/em&gt;
Suppose \(\frac ab\) and \(\frac cd\) are as in the statement.
Now suppose \(\frac xy\) is adjacent to both \(\frac ab\) and \(\frac cd\).
Suppose first for definiteness that \(ay - bx = 1\).
By the lemma, we have that \((x,y) = (ka + c, kb + d)\) for some integer \(k\).
By assumption, we have \(cy - dx = \pm 1\), so the lemma shows that \((x,y) = (\ell c \mp a,\ell d \mp b)\)
for some integer \(\ell.\)
Therefore we have \(a(k \pm 1) = (\ell - 1)c\) and \(b(k \pm 1) = (\ell-1)d\),
from which it follows that \((k \pm 1)(\ell - 1)(ad - bc) = 0\).
Therefore either \(k = \mp 1\) or \(\ell = 1\),
both of which imply \((x,y) = (c \mp a,d \mp b)\).
If instead we have \(ay-bx = -1\), then the conclusion is the same.
We of course have \(\frac{c \mp a}{d \mp b} = \frac{a \pm c}{b \pm d}\). \(\blacksquare\)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-action-of-operatornamesl_2mathbbz&quot;&gt;The action of \(\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section we analyze the action of \(\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\) on the Farey diagram,
proving that it is transitive on edges and triangles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First let us define the action of \(\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\) on the Farey diagram.
The action of \(\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\) on \(\mathbb{Z}^2\)
restricts to an action on the vertex set of the Farey diagram.
Indeed, \(a\) and \(b\) are relatively prime if and only if there exists integers \(x\) and \(y\)
such that \(ax + by = 1\)
if and only if \((a,b)\) is the first column of a matrix in \(\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\)
if and only if there is an element of \(\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\) taking \((1,0)\) to \((a,b)\).
In terms of fractions, if \(z = \frac{p}{q}\) is a vertex of the Farey diagram,
then the action of \(\begin{pmatrix} a &amp;amp; b \\ c &amp;amp; d \end{pmatrix}\) sends \(z\) to&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{az + b}{cz + d} = \frac{ap + bq}{cp + dq}.\]

&lt;p&gt;This action preserves adjacency: the reader is encouraged to figure out why.
Indeed, the action is transitive on edges:
can you show that if \(\frac ab\) and \(\frac cd\) are adjacent in the diagram,
there is an element of \(\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\) sending the edge between \(\frac 01\) and \(\frac 10\)
to the edge between \(\frac ab\) and \(\frac cd\)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, put a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_order&quot;&gt;cyclic order&lt;/a&gt; on the vertex set of the Farey diagram
by taking the cyclic order induced by the linear order on \(\mathbb{Q} \cup \{\infty\}\).
That is, given three distinct elements \(p\), \(q\) and \(r\) in \(\mathbb{Q}\cup\infty\),
say \((p,q,r)\) is &lt;em&gt;cyclically ordered&lt;/em&gt; if
\(a &amp;lt; b &amp;lt; c\) or \(b &amp;lt; c &amp;lt; a\) or \(c &amp;lt; a &amp;lt; b\) holds.
For example \((\infty,-2,0)\) is cyclically ordered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proposition.&lt;/strong&gt; Suppose \(p\), \(q\) and \(r\) are the vertices of a triangle in the Farey diagram and that
\((p,q,r)\) is cyclically ordered.
Then there is an element of \(\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\) sending \((0,1,\infty)\) to \((p,q,r)\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proof.&lt;/em&gt;
Suppose \(p = \frac cd\) and \(r = \frac ab\).
Because \(p\) and \(r\) are adjacent in the Farey diagram,
the matrix \(\begin{pmatrix} a &amp;amp; c \\ b &amp;amp; d \end{pmatrix}\) has determinant \(\pm 1\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assume first that \(ad-bc = 1\), i.e. that \(p &amp;lt; r\).
Then the claim is that \(q = \frac{a+c}{b+d}\),
which is the image of \(\frac 11\) under the matrix \(\begin{pmatrix} a &amp;amp; c \\ b &amp;amp; d\end{pmatrix}\).
In other words, the claim is that \((p,\frac{a-c}{b-d},r)\) is not circularly ordered,
for which we need to show that \(p&amp;lt;\frac{a-c}{b-d}&amp;lt;r\) is false.
Assume first that \(b-d\) is nonnegative.
Then \(ad &amp;gt; bc\) implies \(ab - ad &amp;lt; ab - bc\), which implies \(\frac ab &amp;lt; \frac{a-c}{b-d}\), and the claim follows.
Next assume that \(b-d\) is negative.
Then \(ad &amp;gt; bc\) implies that \(ad - dc &amp;gt; bc - dc\), which implies \(\frac{a-c}{b-d} &amp;lt; \frac cd\),
and the claim follows (Note that we assume that \(d\) is nonnegative.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next assume that \(ad - bc = -1\), i.e. that \(r &amp;lt; p\).
Then the claim is that \(q = \frac{a-c}{b-d}\),
which is the image of \(\frac 11\) under the matrix \(\begin{pmatrix} a &amp;amp; - c \\ b &amp;amp; -d\end{pmatrix}\)
in \(\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\).
In other words, the claim is that \((p,\frac{a+c}{b+d},r)\) is not circularly ordered,
for which we need to show that it neither \(\frac{a+c}{b+d} &amp;lt; r &amp;lt; p\) nor \(r &amp;lt; p &amp;lt; \frac{a+c}{b+d}\) holds.
In fact, \(ad &amp;lt; bc\) implies \(ab + bc &amp;gt; ab + ad\) holds, which implies \(\frac{a+c}{b+d} &amp;gt; \frac ab\).
But, \(ad &amp;lt; bc\) implies that \(ad + dc &amp;lt; bc + dc\), which implies that \(\frac{a+c}{b+d} &amp;lt; \frac cd\),
and the claim follows. \(\blacksquare\)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the proof above shows that the matrix in \(\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\)
is unique up to multiplication of all the entries by \(-1\).
This corresponds to the matrix \(\begin{pmatrix} -1 &amp;amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp;amp; -1 \end{pmatrix}\),
which generates the &lt;em&gt;center&lt;/em&gt; of \(\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corollary.&lt;/strong&gt; The stabilizer of a triangle is isomorphic to \(C_3 \times C_2 \cong C_6\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An explicit generator for the cyclic group of order \(6\) stabilizing the triangle spanned by \((0,1,\infty)\)
is \(\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp;amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp;amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposition also yields an element of \(\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\) interchanging \(0\) and \(\infty\):
this element is \(\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp;amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp;amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}\).
This element is unique up to multiplication by \(-1\) and has order \(4\), so we have proven the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corollary.&lt;/strong&gt; The stabilizer of an edge is isomorphic to \(C_4\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;edges-do-not-cross&quot;&gt;Edges do not cross&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finish this post by proving that edges of the Farey diagram do not cross,
in the sense that if \(p\) and \(q\) are adjacent and \(r\) and \(s\) are adjacent
and \(p\), \(q\), \(r\) and \(s\) are all distinct,
then if \((p,r,q)\) is cyclically ordered, then \((p,s,q)\) is also cyclically ordered.
By results in the previous section, we may assume \(p = 0\) and \(q = \infty\).
That is, if \(r = \frac ab\) is positive and \(\frac cd\) is adjacent to \(\frac ab\),
then \(\frac cd\) is also positive.
By swapping the roles of \(r\) and \(s\) if necessary, we may assume that \(ad - bc = 1\).
Since we assume that \(a\), \(b\), and \(d\) are positive integers, then we must have \(c \ge 0\)
in order to satisfy \(ad -bc = 1\).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The Farey graph, or Farey diagram, is an object that appears in many guises throughout math.

with a free action on a &lt;em&gt;real tree&lt;/em&gt; is a free product of free abelian and surface groups.
The purpose of this blog post is to introduce real trees and illustrate this theorem by constructing
free actions of such groups on real trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us begin by defining real trees.
An &lt;em&gt;arc&lt;/em&gt; in a space \(X\) is an embedding \(\gamma\colon [a,b] \to X\)
of a closed interval of \(\mathbb{R}\) in \(X\).
If \((X,d)\) is a metric space,
an arc in \(X\) is a &lt;em&gt;geodesic&lt;/em&gt; if the embedding is an isometric embedding—that is,
for all \(s\) and \(t\) in \([a,b]\), we have&lt;/p&gt;

\[d(\gamma(s),\gamma(t)) = |t - s|.\]

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;real tree&lt;/em&gt; or an \(\mathbb{R}\)&lt;em&gt;-tree&lt;/em&gt; is a metric space \((T,d)\)
in which every two points are joined by a unique arc,
and this arc is the image of a geodesic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;examples-of-real-trees&quot;&gt;Examples of real trees&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see a couple of examples of real trees.
As a first example,
\(\mathbb{R}\) is a real tree.
If \(X\) is a simply connected simplicial complex of dimension \(1\),
that is, a &lt;em&gt;simplicial tree,&lt;/em&gt;
we can define a metric on \(X\)
by declaring each edge of \(X\) to be isometric to an interval of \(\mathbb{R}\) of length \(1\),
and then giving \(X\) the metric where the distance between two points is the length of a shortest path between them.
In this metric, \(X\) becomes a real tree.
The metric topology is in general strictly coarser than the simplicial topology.
This means the “identity” map from the simplicial complex \(X\) to the metric space \(X\) is continuous,
but its inverse need not be continuous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;free-abelian-groups-act-freely-on-real-trees&quot;&gt;Free abelian groups act freely on real trees&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not hard to construct free actions of finitely generated free abelian groups on real trees,
in fact the word “tree” is somewhat obfuscating:
the real tree in question is the real line \(\mathbb{R}\).
Let \(a_1,\dotsc,a_n\) be a basis for \(\mathbb{Z}^n\).
Have each \(a_i\) act by translation on \(\mathbb{R}\) by some distance \(t_i\).
If the \(t_i\) are not rationally related, then the resulting action of \(\mathbb{Z}^n\) is free.
It also has &lt;em&gt;dense orbits,&lt;/em&gt; a property of some other actions of groups on real trees
that I struggled to visualize—I find this simpler example helpful in that regard!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;surface-groups-act-freely-on-real-trees&quot;&gt;Surface groups act freely on real trees&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is admittedly more complicated.
Let \(S\) be a surface equipped with a complete Riemannian metric of constant sectional curvature \(-1\).
A &lt;em&gt;measured geodesic lamination&lt;/em&gt; \((\mathscr{L},\mu)\) on \(S\)
is a closed subset \(\mathscr{L} \subset S\) (the &lt;em&gt;lamination&lt;/em&gt;) which decomposes as a disjoint union of
complete geodesics (called &lt;em&gt;leaves&lt;/em&gt;)
together with a &lt;em&gt;transverse measure&lt;/em&gt; \(\mu\).
This is an assignment, for each arc \(c\) transverse to \(\mathscr{L}\),
of a Radon measure \(\mu|_c\) with support equal to \(c \cap \mathscr{L}\)
that is invariant under homotopy transverse to \(\mathscr{L}\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a bit of a mouthful, sorry!
A simple example of a measured geodesic lamination is just a closed geodesic \(\gamma\) on \(S\),
where the transverse measure simply counts the points of intersections of arcs \(c\) with \(\gamma\).
Notice that even if an arc \(c\) transverse to \(\gamma\) is homotopic to an arc with fewer points of intersection,
this homotopy cannot be performed transverse to \(\gamma\), so the measure is really homotopy invariant.
There are measured geodesic laminations with stranger properties
than those that come from closed geodesics,
but I think it can be helpful when trying to picture things involving geodesic laminations,
to just imagine the closed geodesic case and think of a general measured geodesic lamination
as being a sort of generalization or “limit” of this picture.
Thurston has a cute picture in his notes on the geometry and topology of 3-manifolds, see below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/geodesiclamination.png&quot; alt=&quot;Thurston&apos;s picture of a geodesic lamination&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let \((\mathscr{L},\mu)\) be a measured geodesic lamination.
We can lift it to a \(\pi_1(S)\)-invariant measured geodesic lamination \((\tilde{\mathscr{L}},\tilde\mu)\)
on the universal cover \(\tilde S\) of \(S\).
I will describe &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004093839190002L&quot;&gt;Morgan and Shalen’s&lt;/a&gt;
construction of a real tree &lt;em&gt;dual&lt;/em&gt; to \((\tilde{\mathscr{L}},\tilde\mu)\).
Since \((\tilde{\mathscr{L}},\tilde\mu)\) is \(\pi_1(S)\)-invariant,
we will obtain an action of \(\pi_1(S)\) by isometries on the dual real tree.
Let \(C\) be the set of complementary components of \(\tilde S\setminus \tilde{\mathscr{L}}\).
Given components \(c\) and \(c&apos;\),
let \(\gamma\) be a path with one endpoint in \(c\) and the other in \(c&apos;\)
such that \(\gamma\) is transverse to \(\tilde{\mathscr{L}}\) and intersects each leaf of \(\tilde{\mathscr{L}}\)
at most once.
For example, given a point \(x\) in \(c\) and \(y\) in \(c&apos;\),
the path \(\gamma\) could be the unique geodesic from \(x\) to \(y\).
Define&lt;/p&gt;

\[d(c,c&apos;) = \int_\gamma d\tilde\mu.\]

&lt;p&gt;Morgan and Shalen show that this defines a well-defined distance function on \(C\),
and that this distance satisfies a \(0\)-hyperbolicity condition,
therefore there is a real tree \(T\) equipped with an isometric embedding \(C \to T\)
such that \(T\) is the smallest subtree containing the image of \(C\).
This tree \(T\) is unique up to unique isometry,
so in particular the action of \(\pi_1(S)\) on \(C\) extends to an action on \(T\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us return to our example of a measured geodesic lamination \((\mathscr{L},\mu)\),
where \(\mathscr{L}\) was a closed geodesic \(\gamma\)
and the transverse measure \(\mu\) counted intersection points.
Thinking of \(\gamma\) as an element of \(\pi_1(S)\),
the lamination \(\tilde{\mathscr{L}}\) has a leaf for each conjugate of \(\gamma\) in \(\pi_1(S)\),
and each leaf separates \(\tilde S\) into two components.
The minimal intersection number for a path joining the complementary components is \(1\),
so adjacent components are at distance one in \(T\).
In fact, if you know a little Bass–Serre theory,
the dual tree turns out to be exactly the Bass–Serre tree for the one-edge splitting of \(\pi_1(S)\)
with edge group \(\langle\gamma\rangle\), where each edge has been assigned length \(1\)!
Notice that the action of \(\pi_1(S)\) on this particular tree is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan and Shalen show that the stabilizer of a point \(p\) in \(T\) under the action of \(\pi_1(S)\)
is the stabilizer of the corresponding component of \(\tilde S \setminus \tilde{\mathscr{L}}\) if
\(p\) is in the image of \(C\), and is the stabilizer of a leaf of \(\mathscr{L}\) otherwise.
Their key result (which they prove with a Baire Category Theorem argument!)
is the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem.&lt;/strong&gt; If \(S\) is a closed hyperbolic surface that is not the connect sum of three projective planes,
there is a measured geodesic lamination \((\mathscr{L},\mu)\) on \(S\)
all of whose leaves and complementary components are simply connected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It follows that the action of \(\pi_1(S)\) on the dual tree \(T\) is free.
Morgan and Shalen also prove algebraically that if \(S\) &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the connect sum of three projective planes,
then \(\pi_1(S)\) cannot act freely on a real tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;free-products-of-groups-acting-freely&quot;&gt;Free products of groups acting freely&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the remainder of this post,
we will prove the following theorem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem.&lt;/strong&gt; If \(A\) and \(B\) are groups acting freely on real trees \(S\) and \(T\),
then there is a real tree \(X\) on which the free product \(A*B\) acts freely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If \(G\) is a finitely generated group,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grushko_theorem&quot;&gt;Grushko’s theorem&lt;/a&gt;
says that the number of factors in any free product decomposition of \(G\) is finite,
so applying the theorem inductively provides examples of free actions
of finitely generated free products of free abelian and surface groups.
(Provided, of course, that none of the surfaces in question are the projective plane,
the Klein bottle, or the connect sum of three projective planes.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proof.&lt;/em&gt; The free product \(G = A*B\) acts on a (simplicial) tree \(Y\)
with two orbits of vertices and one orbit of edges with trivial edge stabilizers.
By the orbit stabilizer theorem, the tree has the following description.
The vertex set is the union of the sets of cosets of \(A\) and \(B\) in \(G\),
and the edge set is the set of elements of \(G\).
The edge labeled \(g\) connects the vertices labeled \(gA\) and \(gB\).
Choose points \(s \in S\) and \(t \in T\).
The real tree \(X\) will be constructed in the following way.
We replace vertices of \(Y\) with copies of \(S\) or \(T\), corresponding to whether
the vertex corresponded to a coset of \(A\) or \(B\), respectively,
gluing the edges of \(Y\) so that one endpoint lies in a copy of \(S\) and the other in a copy of \(T\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explicitly the space \(X\) is the quotient of the disjoint union \(G\times S \sqcup G \times T \sqcup G\times [0,1]\)
by the following relations, where \(g \in G\), \(x \in S\), \(y \in T\), \(a \in A\) and \(b \in B\):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;\((ga,x) \sim (g,a.x)\),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;\((gb,y) \sim (g,b.y)\),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;\((g,0) \sim (g,s)\) and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;\((g,1) \sim (g,t)\).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One checks that the relations imply that there is a copy of \(S\) for each coset \(gA\) in \(G\),
a copy of \(T\) for each coset \(gB\) in \(G\),
and an edge \([0,1]\) for each element of \(G\).
Since \(Y\) was a tree, \(X\) will be a real tree.
The multiplication in the labels of the disjoint union yields an action of \(G\) on \(X\) by isometries.
There is a natural equivariant map \(X \to Y\) that collapses each copy of \(S\) and each copy of \(T\) to a point.
Each element \(g\) of \(G\) either acts freely on \(Y\) (in which case it must act freely on \(X\)),
or it stabilizes a unique vertex of \(Y\), in which case \(g\) is conjugate to an element of \(A\) or \(B\).
In this latter case, \(g\) preserves a copy of \(S\) or \(T\) 
and one checks that it acts as an element of \(A\) or \(B\).
But since the actions of \(A\) and \(B\) were free, it follows that if \(g\) is nontrivial, then it acts freely.

Here’s a short post about something cute that came up in my research this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncngt.org&quot;&gt;NCNGT&lt;/a&gt;, which has been very lovely,
my math this week has been carefully walking through a small side proposition
in a paper I’m working on with &lt;a href=&quot;http://cirget.math.uqam.ca/~tyghaswala/&quot;&gt;Ty Ghaswala&lt;/a&gt;.
The idea is that graphs of groups come with a notion of a covering space due to Bass,
and étale groupoids come with their own notion of covering spaces
(for us, we’re following the definition in Bridson–Haefliger),
and given that you can construct an étale groupoid associated to any graph of groups,
I wanted to reconcile the two notions.
The proof ends up being a story of very careful bookkeeping;
I spent much more of this week than I expected trying to gently pin down what goes where
and why and balance the sudden explosion of notation it seemed to require—not the most fun,
but so it goes. And then right at the very end I had this delightful little puzzle. Let me tell you about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I happened to be staring at the following commutative diagram of groups and homomorphisms,
all of which are injective in the particular case I was concerned with&lt;/p&gt;

\[\require{AMScd}\begin{CD}
  \mathscr{L}_{\hat e} @&amp;gt;f_{\hat e}&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \mathscr{G}_e \\
  @V\iota_{\hat e}VV @VV\operatorname{ad}(\delta_{\hat e})\iota_eV \\
  \mathscr{L}_w @&amp;gt;f_w&amp;gt;&amp;gt; \mathscr{G}_v.
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;It’s not really important what these groups &lt;em&gt;are,&lt;/em&gt;
but in case you’re curious this is a commutative diagram associated to a morphism of graphs of groups—in
my particular case, a covering map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I wanted to know, is the image of \(\mathscr{L}_e\) under these maps
equal to the intersection \(f_w(\mathscr{G}_w) \cap \operatorname{ad}(\delta_{\hat e})\iota_e(\mathscr{G}_e)\)?
Since the situation is pretty general, I wondered if there was maybe a universal property argument:
like, if in the situation above, the square is always a &lt;em&gt;pullback square,&lt;/em&gt;
then maybe we would be able to show that the two subgroups above were equal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that I had it kind of backwards:
Given injective homomorphisms \(f\colon H \to G\) and \(g\colon K \to G\), the &lt;em&gt;pullback&lt;/em&gt;
\(H\times_G K\) is (up to unique isomorphism) the intersection \(f(H) \cap g(K)\).
Recall that the pullback
is characterized by the following universal property:
it fits in the following commutative diagram&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
  H\times_G K @&amp;gt;\pi_2&amp;gt;&amp;gt; K \\
  @V\pi_1VV @VVgV \\
  H @&amp;gt;f&amp;gt;&amp;gt; G,
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;and is universal for this property in the sense that given a group \(L\)
fitting into the commutative diagram&lt;/p&gt;

\[\begin{CD}
  L @&amp;gt;p_2&amp;gt;&amp;gt; K \\
  @Vp_1VV @VVgV \\
  H @&amp;gt;f&amp;gt;&amp;gt; G
\end{CD}\]

&lt;p&gt;there is a unique homomorphism \(q\colon L \to H\times_GK\) such that
\(\pi_2q = p_2\) and \(\pi_1q = p_1.\)
(If there was justice and not MathJax in this world, I’d draw the full commutative diagram I’m alluding to here.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So! Assuming \(f\) and \(g\) are injective, let’s prove that \(H\times_GK\) is the intersection
\(f(H)\cap g(K)\).
This is not hard: first observe that the intersection admits maps \(\pi_1 \colon f(H)\cap g(K) \to H\)
and \(\pi_2\colon f(H)\cap g(K) \to K\):
\(\pi_1\) takes \(g \in f(H)\cap g(K)\), recognizes we can write it as \(f(\hat g)\)
for a unique \(\hat g\) in \(H\), and sends \(g\) to \(\hat g\).
Injectivity of \(f\) assures that this really defines a well-defined homomorphism,
while general properties of functions assure that \(\pi_1\) is injective.
The compositions \(f\pi_1\) and \(g\pi_2\) are the natural inclusion \(\iota\colon f(H)\cap g(K) \to G\).
The map \(\pi_2\) is defined similarly.
Next observe that any group \(L\) fitting into the commutative diagram above
clearly maps into \(f(H)\cap g(K)\), in other words,
the map \(fp_1 = gp_2\) factor through a map \(q\colon L \to f(H)\cap g(K)\) as \(\iota q\).
From here it’s not hard to argue that in fact \(\pi_1q = p_1\) and \(\pi_2q = p_2\); I’ll leave it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though in my particular situation I had the universals backwards,
I did find this realization clarifying:
it showed that to prove my result,
I needed to show that \(\mathscr{L}_e\) way up above has the universal property of the pullback,
for which it suffices to argue that given an element in the intersection
\(f_w(\mathscr{L}_w) \cap \operatorname{ad}(\delta_{\hat e})\iota_e(\mathscr{G}_e)\),
we can pull it back (as it were) and show that it really comes from an element of \(\mathscr{L}_e\).
This turned out to be true thanks to an extra property my situation enjoys!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Sometimes a pullback square is an intersection!

about Nielsen realization for infinite-type surfaces.
The format for the conference is that everyone records and uploads their talks beforehand,
and then the conference format allows for discussion and comments via Discord.
The purpose of this post is to share and talk a little bit about my talk, which is below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/QwA3bSwkcW0&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nielsen realization problem was posed by Nielsen in 1932.
The &lt;em&gt;mapping class group&lt;/em&gt; of a surface \(S\),
call it \(\operatorname{Map}(S)\),
is the group of isotopy classes of homeomorphisms of \(S\).
For a subgroup \(G\) of \(\operatorname{Map}(S)\),
it is not generally possible to realize \(G\)
as a group of honest homeomorphisms of \(S\).
Nielsen’s question was whether, in the special case that \(G\) is finite, such a realization is always possible.
Kerckhoff answered Nielsen’s question in the affirmative in 1983 for finite-type surfaces.
In fact, Kerckhoff showed the stronger result that finite subgroups of \(\operatorname{Map}(S)\)
arise as groups of isometries of hyperbolic metrics on \(S\)
(when \(S\) supports a hyperbolic metric, of course).
The first and main theorem I discuss in my talk,
which is joint work with &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/view/santanaafton/home&quot;&gt;Santana Afton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.uchicago.edu/~dannyc/&quot;&gt;Danny Calegari&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://lvzhouchen.github.io&quot;&gt;Lvzhou Chen&lt;/a&gt;,
is an extension of Kerckhoff’s result to orientable, infinite-type surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kerckhoff’s proof is very cool;
I talk through the main ideas in my talk,
but briefly he defines a \(G\)-invariant, real-valued function on the &lt;em&gt;Teichmüller space of \(S\),&lt;/em&gt;
which parametrizes (homotopy classes of) hyperbolic metrics on \(S\),
and shows that it attains a unique minimum, which is therefore fixed by \(G\).
This fixed point yields a realization of \(G\) as a group of isometries of the corresponding hyperbolic metric.
Kerckhoff’s proof does not work for infinite-type surfaces
basically because a certain finite sum in the definition of his function in the finite-type case
would need to become an infinite series,
and the obvious definition yields a divergent series.
As I mention in the talk,
I’d be very interested in talking with you
if you have ideas about how to weight this series to produce one that converges.
Instead the proof that we give involves cutting our surface up into finite-type pieces,
and applying Kerckhoff’s result to each of the pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I became interested in infinite-type surfaces and their mapping class groups
after reading a very cool (and short) &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10060&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;
of &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/view/lovingmath/home?authuser=0&quot;&gt;Marissa Kawehi Loving&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://justinlanier.org&quot;&gt;Justin Lanier&lt;/a&gt;
finding interesting subgroups of big mapping class groups that cannot be found in finite-type mapping class groups.
It’s a theorem that \(\operatorname{Map}(S)\) is a subgroup of the symmetric group on a countable set.
I wondered whether the symmetric group on a countable set is ever a subgroup of a big mapping class group.
The second result I discuss in the talk has the corollary that &lt;em&gt;no,&lt;/em&gt;
the symmetric group on a countable set cannot continuously embed in any big mapping class group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, after reading a draft of our paper, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.math.utah.edu/~bestvina/&quot;&gt;Mladen Bestvina&lt;/a&gt; suggested to me
that we should be able to use our techniques to prove that compact subgroups of mapping class groups are finite
and locally compact subgroups are discrete.
After a few days of thinking, I was able to find a proof!
It includes my new favorite way of proving that a group is finite:
show that it is &lt;em&gt;torsion,&lt;/em&gt; that every element has finite order,
and that it is &lt;em&gt;virtually torsion free,&lt;/em&gt; i.e. that it has a finite-index torsion-free subgroup.
Only the trivial subgroup of such a group is torsion free,
so this shows that the trivial subgroup has finite index in the whole group—so the group is finite.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’m giving a talk in Nearly Carbon Neutral Geometric Topology about Nielsen realization for infinite-type surfaces.

to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncngt.org&quot;&gt;Nearly Carbon Neutral Geometric Topology&lt;/a&gt; conference.
The purpose of this post is to share the postcard
and offer a little more context and explanation for it.
I’m also giving a talk in said conference,
but I’ll talk about that in a separate post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the postcard:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;/assets/pdfs/postcard.pdf&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;400px&quot;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me say a little more about the space we’re talking about.
Let&lt;/p&gt;

\[F = A_1*\dotsb*A_n*F_k\]

&lt;p&gt;be a free product of the groups \(A_1,\dotsc,A_n\) with a free group of rank \(k\).
It follows from elementary Bass–Serre theory
that \(F\) acts on a (simplicial) tree \(T\) with trivial edge stabilizers
and vertex stabilizers each conjugate to some \(A_i\).
Let’s assume that the action is &lt;em&gt;minimal,&lt;/em&gt; i.e. that there is no proper invariant subtree.
Say two such trees \(S\) and \(T\) are &lt;em&gt;equivalent&lt;/em&gt; if there is an \(F\)-equivariant homeomorphism from \(S\) to \(T\).
It turns out that there are many inequivalent, minimal actions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0501288&quot;&gt;Guirardel and Levitt&lt;/a&gt; define an Outer Space to parametrize them all
(up to a finer notion of equivalence: isometry).
It is a topological space on which the group of those outer automorphisms of \(F\)
which preserve the conjugacy classes of the \(A_i\) acts.
If the \(A_i\) are &lt;em&gt;freely indecomposable,&lt;/em&gt; for example, if they are finite,
then this is all of \(\operatorname{Out}(F)\).
This Outer Space admits a &lt;em&gt;spine,&lt;/em&gt;
a subspace which is a simplicial complex
and onto which it deformation retracts \(\operatorname{Out}(F)\)-equivariantly.
Vertices of the spine are equivalence classes of minimal actions as above.
Two vertices are connected by an edge when one can be obtained from the other by collapsing an orbit of edges.
When \(n \ge 2\), the dimension of this spine is \(n + 2k - 2\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When each \(A_i\) is finite, the spine is locally finite,
and \(\operatorname{Out}(F)\) acts with finite stabilizers and finite quotient.
This is the bread-and-butter situation for geometric group theory,
so outer automorphism groups of free products of finite and cyclic groups are interesting to study as a class
because one can use the geometry of the spine of Outer Space to investigate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again by Bass–Serre theory, one can think of vertices of the spine
via their quotient graphs of groups \(\mathcal{G}\),
as is happening in the postcard.
These quotient graphs of groups will have first Betti number \(k\)
and \(n\) vertices with nontrivial vertex group each isomorphic to one of the \(A_i\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combinatorial types of the examples in the postcard play a particularly special role
in studying the spine of Outer Space.
I call vertices combinatorially equivalent to the first and last examples &lt;em&gt;thistles&lt;/em&gt;
with \(n\) prickles and \(k\) petals (here \(n = 3\) and \(k = 4\)).
Vertices combinatorially equivalent to the middle examples are &lt;em&gt;bugs&lt;/em&gt;
with a head, \(n-1\) legs and \(k\) wings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason thistles and bugs are special is illustrated in the postcard:
&lt;em&gt;collapse Whitehead moves&lt;/em&gt; along with their cousins &lt;em&gt;expand Whitehead moves,&lt;/em&gt;
form a system of paths in the spine of Outer Space that connect any two thistles to each other.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01236258&quot;&gt;Collins and Zieschang&lt;/a&gt; prove a version of Whitehead’s algorithm for free products
using in particular two families of &lt;em&gt;Whitehead automorphisms&lt;/em&gt; that they call \(S\)-Whitehead automorphisms
and \(J\)-multiple Whitehead automorphisms.
The former correspond to expand Whitehead moves, and the latter to collapse Whitehead moves,
and their result says that any two thistles in the spine of Outer Space may be connected by a path of Whitehead moves
which has a very nice interplay with a &lt;em&gt;norm&lt;/em&gt; one can put on thistles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/expandWhitehead.png&quot; alt=&quot;An expand Whitehead move&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me finish by indicating my interest in these paths:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004093839400042J&quot;&gt;Vogtmann&lt;/a&gt; proved that the outer automorphism group of a free group of rank \(k\)
is what’s called &lt;em&gt;simply connected at infinity&lt;/em&gt; for \(k \ge 5\).
Briefly, a space \(X\) is simply connected at infinity if it has one &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_(topology)&quot;&gt;end&lt;/a&gt; 
and for any compact subset \(K\),
there is a compact subset \(L\) with \(L \supset K\) such that
any loop in \(X\setminus L\) is nullhomotopic via a homotopy in \(X\setminus K\).
A group is simply connected at infinity if some (and hence any) simplicial complex
on which it acts with finite stabilizers and finite quotient is simply connected at infinity.
So \(\mathbb{R}\) has two ends, \(\mathbb{R}^2\) has one end but is not simply connected at infinity,
and \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\) is simply connected at infinity for \(n \ge 3\);
therefore \(\mathbb{Z}^n\) is simply connected at infinity for \(n \ge 3\).
Vogtmann’s proof involves a careful understanding of the combinatorics of (expand) Whitehead moves
in the spine of Outer Space (for a free group).
I’m in the early stages of working on generalizing her result to free products of finite and cyclic groups.
The general strategy of the proof will follow hers,
but already I am seeing that the presence of collapse Whitehead moves will require their own analysis to handle.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I submitted a “mathematical postcard” (see below) to the Nearly Carbon Neutral Geometric Topology conference.
