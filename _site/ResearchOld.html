<h2 id="geometric-group-theory-without-boundaries">Geometric Group Theory without Boundaries</h2>

<p>Along with Macarena Arenas, Sami Douba and Abdul Zalloum,
I organized a virtual “summer school” that will ran July 2020.
More info is available on the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ggtwb/home?authuser=0">summer school website</a>.</p>

<p>I gave three lectures in this summer school on Bass and Serre’s theory 
of graphs of groups and groups acting on trees.</p>

<p>Here are notes (with the annotations I added live)
for the lectures, as well as links to recordings of the lectures.</p>

  <li><strong>Train Tracks on Graphs of Groups and Outer Automorphisms of Hyperbolic Groups</strong><br />
<em>PhD thesis</em>. Available at: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00164">arXiv:2005.00164</a><br />
Abstract:
    <blockquote>
      <p>Stallings remarked that an outer automorphism of a free group
may be thought of as a subdivision of a graph followed by a sequence of folds.
In this thesis, we prove that automorphisms of fundamental groups of graphs of groups
satisfying this condition may be represented by irreducible train track maps
in the sense of Bestvina–Handel (we allow collapsing invariant subgraphs).
Of course, we construct relative train track maps as well.
Along the way, we give a new exposition of the Bass–Serre theory of groups acting on trees,
morphisms of graphs of groups, and foldings thereof.
We produce normal forms for automorphisms of free products and extend an argument
of Qing–Rafi to show that they are not quasi-geodesic.
As an application, we answer affirmatively a question of Paulin:
outer automorphisms of finitely generated word hyperbolic groups
satisfy a dynamical trichotomy generalizing the Nielsen–Thurston
“periodic, reducible of pseudo-Anosov.” At the end of the thesis
we collect some open problems we find interesting.</p>

<em>Accepted.</em> Available at: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09760">arXiv:2002.09760</a><br />
Abstract:
    <blockquote>
      <p>Given a subgroup \(G\) of the mapping class group of a surface \(S\),
the Nielsen realization problem asks whether \(G\) can be realized
as a finite group of homeomorphisms of \(S\). In 1983, Kerckhoff
showed that for \(S\) a finite-type surface, any finite subgroup \(G\)
may be realized as a group of isometries of some hyperbolic metric on \(S\).
We extend Kerckhoff’s result to orientable, infinite-type surfaces.
As applications, we classify torsion elements in the mapping class group
of the plane minus a Cantor set, and also show that topological groups
containing sequences of torsion elements limiting to the identity do not
embed continuously into the mapping class group of \(S\). Finally,
we show that compact subgroups of the mapping class group of \(S\) are finite,
and locally compact subgroups are discrete.</p>

  <li><strong>Some new CAT(0) free-by-cyclic groups</strong> <br />
<em>Accepted.</em> Available at: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03097">arXiv:1909.03097</a><br />
Abstract:
    <blockquote>
      <p>We show the existence
of several new infinite families of polynomially-growing automorphisms of
free groups whose mapping tori are CAT(0) free-by-cyclic groups. Such mapping
tori are thick, and thus not relatively hyperbolic. These are the first
families comprising infinitely many examples for each rank of the nonabelian
free group; they contrast strongly with Gersten’s example of a thick
free-by-cyclic group, which cannot be a subgroup of a CAT(0) group.</p>
