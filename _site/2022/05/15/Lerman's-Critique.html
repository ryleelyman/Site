      <h1>Lerman's Critique</h1>
<p>15 May 2022</p>

<p><a href="https://ems.press/content/serial-article-files/6839">Lerman</a> critiques the category of étale groupoids with arrows generalized maps
by arguing that there is a problem with gluing maps.
The purpose of this blog post is to try to digest this critique.
We follow the notation set up in the previous two blog posts.</p>

<p>Lerman’s critique takes place in the realm of bibundles,
but as we saw in the <a href="/2022/05/15/Maps-of-%C3%A9tale-groupoids.html">previous post</a>,
it’s possible to translate from the bibundles point of view to the generalized maps point of view.</p>

<p>Lerman’s bibundles \(X\) and \(Y\) are from \(S^1\), 
thought of as a groupoid with only identity arrows,
to \(C_2\), thought of as a groupoid with one object.
If you chase through the definitions,
you see that a bibundle is thus a principal \(C_2\) bundle over \(S^1\).
There are two: the trivial bundle \(S^1\times C_2\)
and the nontrivial bundle which is \(S^1\) double covering itself.
Call the former \(X\) and the latter \(Y\).
The former bundle has a global section and so ought to be represented by an honest functor \(S^1 \to C_2\).
There is only one such functor, sending every object of \(S^1\) to the unique object of \(C_2\)
and sending all the arrows to the identity.</p>

<p>For the nontrivial bundle \(Y\),
we can choose contractible open neighborhoods \(U_1\) and \(U_2\) which cover \(S^1\)
and on which there exist local sections \(s_1\) and \(s_2\).
The groupoid \((S^1)^{\mathcal{U}}\) has space of objects the disjoint copy of two open intervals in \(\mathbb{R}\)
and space of arrows of the form
\((1_x)_{j,i} \colon x_i \to x_j\) for \(x \in U_i \cap U_j\).
Topologically this space of arrows is a copy of the object space (for the identity arrows)
together with two copies of the intersection \(U_1 \cap U_2\) (which is disconnected),
one for arrows of the form \((1_x)_{1,2}\) and another for the arrows \((1_x)_{2,1}\).</p>

<p>Aha! Think about the definition of these local sections:
on one component of the intersection \(U_1\cap U_2\), the sections agree,
while on the other, they differ by the action of \(C_2\).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/circlebundle.jpeg" alt="The nontrivial bundle with its local sections" /></p>

<p>In other words, if we chase through the construction given in the <a href="/2022/05/15/Maps-of-%C3%A9tale-groupoids.html">previous post</a>,
we see that the resulting functor \((S^2)^{\mathcal{U}} \to C_2\)
sends all identity arrows to the identity arrow of \(C_2\) (as they must be sent),
and for \(x\) in the first component of \(U_1 \cap U_2\),
the arrows \((1_x)_{1,2}\) and \((1_x)_{2,1}\) are sent to the identity,
while for all \(x\) in the second component of \(U_1 \cap U_2\),
the arrows \((1_x)_{1,2}\) and \((1_x)_{2,1}\) are sent to the nontrivial arrow in \(C_2\).</p>

<p>It’s clear in bibundle land that these are the two isomorphism classes of maps from \(S^1\) to \(C_2\),
and I think I buy in generalized map land that any generalized map will be one of these two as well.</p>

<p>The complaint, if I understand it, is this:
we can also define the functor associated to the trivial bundle on the open cover \(\mathcal{U}\).
If you restrict either of these functors to either \(U_1\) or \(U_2\),
you get the same map: since \(U_1\) and \(U_2\) are contractible, the only principal \(C_2\)-bundles
over \(U_1\) and \(U_2\) are trivial.
This is slightly less clear in generalized maps land:
you could imagine cutting up an open interval into a couple pieces and having some of the
identifying arrows on the overlaps map to the nontrivial arrow in \(C_2\).
The point, though, is that you can undo this difference with a natural transformation,
essentially because the subintervals you slice into only overlap their neighbors once,
not twice as in the example above.</p>

<p>I think this is a serious issue:
imagine having only the functors from \(U_1\) and \(U_2\) to \(C_2\).
There’s only one choice of functor and only one generalized map.
Nevertheless, when you try to glue these maps together to give you a new map from \(S^1\) to \(C_2\),
you find that there are <em>two</em> possible maps!
What’s worse, since \(U_1\) and \(U_2\) don’t see the arrows on the overlaps,
there’s <em>no way</em> to tell from the restriction which of the two maps you’re trying to end up with!</p>
