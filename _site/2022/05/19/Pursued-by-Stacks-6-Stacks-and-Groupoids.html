      <h1>Pursued By Stacks 6: Stacks And Groupoids</h1>
<p>19 May 2022</p>

<p>In writing this post, I started to see what’s kind of cool about stacks:
you can treat them almost as if they were spaces
in the sense that, as you’ll see, objects of a stack \(\mathsf{D}\) over a space \(Y\)
are the same thing as maps of stacks \(Y \to \mathsf{D}\),
just like the situation of \(\underline{X}\) for a space \(X\).
The difference is that \(\mathsf{D}\) may have many isomorphisms <em>stacked</em> over 
\(Y \to \mathsf{D}\)
while \(\underline{X}\) has only the identity of \(Y\).</p>

<p>In what might be the final post on stacks for a while,
I’d like to show that every topological stack is isomorphic to
\(\mathsf{B}\mathcal{G}\) for some topological groupoid \(\mathcal{G}\).
We could then say that, for instance, a graph of groups
is any stack isomorphic to \(\mathsf{B}\mathcal{G}\),
where \(\mathcal{G}\) is the étale groupoid we constructed <a href="/2022/05/14/Graphs-of-groups-as-%C3%A9tale-groupoids.html">in a previous post</a>.</p>

<p>Suppose \(\mathsf{D}\) is a topological stack
with an atlas \(p\colon X \to \mathsf{D}\).
We claim that \(X \times_{\mathsf{D}} X\) 
(which is a space since \(X\) is an atlas)
is a space of arrows for a groupoid \(\mathcal{G}\) with space of objects \(X\).
That finished,
we will construct an isomorphism \(\psi\colon \mathsf{D} \to \mathsf{B}\mathcal{G}\).</p>

<p>Thus we are in search of structure maps for our groupoid.
By the 2-Yoneda lemma, 
if \(X\) and \(Y\) are spaces, any map of stacks \(X \to Y\)
is determined up to natural isomorphism by an object of \(\underline{Y}\) over \(X\);
in other words, a continuous map \(f\colon X \to Y\).
But because the fiber of \(\underline{Y}\) comprises only the identity arrow,
this map \(f\) is in fact unique.
Therefore, it suffices to produce maps of stacks for our structure maps.</p>

<p>We take source and target maps of \(\mathcal{G}\) to be the two projections
from \(X\times_{\mathsf{D}} X\) to \(X\).
In more words, \((x,y,f) \mapsto X\) and \((x,y,f) \mapsto Y\).
Note that the diagram</p>

\[\require{AMScd}\begin{CD}
X @&gt;1_X&gt;&gt; X \\
@VV1_XV @VVpV \\
X @&gt;p&gt;&gt; \mathsf{D}
\end{CD}\]

<p>commutes (on the nose),
so there is a map \(X \to X\times_{\mathsf{D}} X\).
If you chase through the definition of maps to the 2-fiber product,
you see that on objects the map is \(Y \mapsto (Y,Y,1_Y)\).</p>

<p>The multiplication map</p>

\[m\colon (X\times_{\mathsf{D}}X)\times_X(X\times_{\mathsf{D}}X) \to X \times_{\mathsf{D}} X\]

<p>is defined on objects as \(((x,y,f),(y,z,g) = (x,z,gf)\).
This multiplication is associative because composition of arrows in \(\mathsf{D}\) is associative.
The inversion map \((\cdot)^{-1}\) is given on objects as</p>

\[(x,y,f)^{-1} = (y,x,f^{-1}).\]

<p>So far we have not used any of the stack properties, 
merely that the category is fibered in groupoids.
(I cannot help myself: if the category were merely fibered in categories, 
whatever that might mean, we would end up with a category which is not a groupoid.)</p>

<p>Now we define \(\psi\colon \mathsf{D} \to \mathsf{B}\mathcal{G}\).
This means that to each object of \(\mathsf{D}\) over a space \(Y\),
we need to produce a principal \(\mathcal{G}\)-bundle over \(Y\).</p>

<p>Recall that by the 2-Yoneda lemma an object of \(\mathsf{D}\) over \(Y\)
is the same thing as a map of stacks \(f\colon Y \to \mathsf{D}\).
Since \(X\) is an atlas, the fiber product \(Y \times_{\mathsf{D}} X\) is a space
and the map \(Y\times_{\mathsf{D}} X \to Y\) is an open surjection which admits local sections.
We let the projection \(Y\times_{\mathsf{D}} X \to X\) be the anchor map
for the right action of \(\mathcal{G}\) defined on objects as</p>

\[\begin{gather*}
(Y\times_{\mathsf{D}} X)\times_X(X\times_{\mathsf{D}}X) \to Y \times_{\mathsf{D}} X \\
((y,x_2,f),(x_1,x_2,g)) \mapsto (y,x_1,g^{-1}f).
\end{gather*}\]

<p>(This disagrees with <a href="https://ems.press/content/serial-article-files/6839">Lerman</a> but is the correct definition for a <em>right</em> action.)</p>

<p>The map</p>

\[(Y\times_{\mathsf{D}}X)\times_X\mathcal{G}_1 
\to (Y\times_{\mathsf{D}}X)\times_Y(Y\times_{\mathsf{D}}X)\]

<p>defined by</p>

\[((y,x_2,f),(x_1,x_2,g)) \mapsto ((y,x_2,f),(y,x_1,g^{-1}f))\]

<p>is clearly (the action on objects of) an isomorphism of stacks,
so the action of \(\mathcal{G}\) on \((Y\times_{\mathsf{D}}X)\) is free and transitive.
Thus we define \(\psi(f\colon M \to \mathsf{D})\) to be the principal \(\mathcal{G}\)-bundle
\(Y \times_{\mathsf{D}}X \to Y\).</p>

<p>Now, if an object of \(\mathsf{D}\) over a space \(Y\) is a map \(f\colon Y \to \mathsf{D}\)
and an object of \(\mathsf{D}\) over a space \(Z\) is a map \(g \colon Z \to \mathsf{D}\),
then an arrow of \(\mathsf{D}\) over the map \(h \colon Y \to Z\)
should in fact be the map \(h \colon Y \to Z\) making the diagram</p>

\[\begin{CD}
Y @&gt;f&gt;&gt; \mathsf{D} \\
@VVhV @| \\
Z @&gt;g&gt;&gt; \mathsf{D}
\end{CD}\]

<p>commute—at least, up to a specified natural isomorphism \(\eta\colon f \Rightarrow gh\).
I think this is a missing naturality statement in the 2-Yoneda lemma,
so expect an appendix.
If we believe that for now, let’s continue.</p>

<p>Now notice that we get a commutative diagram</p>

\[\begin{CD}
Y \times_{\mathsf{D}} X @&gt;&gt;&gt; X \\
@VVh\pi V @VVpV \\
Z @&gt;g&gt;&gt; \mathsf{D}
\end{CD}\]

<p>up to the composite natural transformation \(\epsilon\eta\)
(where \(\epsilon\) is the defining natural transformation for the fiber product
\(Y\times_{\mathsf{D}} X\)).
Therefore by the universal property of the 2-fiber product,
we get a map \(\tilde h\colon Y\times_{\mathsf{D}}X \to Z\times_{\mathsf{D}}X\)
such that the following diagram commutes</p>

\[\begin{CD}
Y\times_{\mathsf{D}}X @&gt;\tilde h&gt;&gt; Z\times_{\mathsf{D}}X \\
@VV\pi V @VV\pi V \\
Y @&gt;h&gt;&gt; Z
\end{CD}\]

<p>up to a natural isomorphism, which must be the identity,
because every object in the diagram is a space.
Specifically, chasing through the map as described when we considered 2-fiber products,
on objects we have
\(\tilde h(y,x,f) = (h(y),x,f)\).
It is clear from this definition that \(\tilde h\) is \(\mathcal{G}\)-equivariant,
and that \(\psi\) is functorial and fully faithful.
We still haven’t used that \(\mathsf{D}\) is a stack!</p>

<p>To complete the proof, we need to show that \(\psi\) is essentially surjective.
First, we show it for \(\mathcal{G}\)-bundles with a global section.
By an argument I think I failed to give—if so, sorry—such a bundle
is (canonically isomorphic to) 
the pullback bundle \(f^*\mathcal{G}_1\) by a map \(f\colon Y \to X\).
Now, given such a map \(f\colon Y \to X\),
notice that the silly diagram</p>

\[\begin{CD}
Y @&gt;pf&gt;&gt; \mathsf{D} \\
@VVfV @| \\
X @&gt;p&gt;&gt; \mathsf{D}
\end{CD}\]

<p>commutes on the nose, so certainly up to natural transformation.
The bundle \(\psi(pf)\) is \(Y\times_{\mathsf{D}}X\) over \(Y\),
which has an equivariant map \(\psi(f)\) to \(\mathcal{G}_1\)
and hence an isomorphism \(Y\times_{\mathsf{D}}X \cong f^*\mathcal{G}_1\).
Therefore \(Y\times_{\mathsf{D}}X\) has a global section \(\sigma\)
with the property, if you chase it through,
that \(\pi_2\sigma \colon Y\times_{\mathsf{D}}X \to X\) is \(k\).</p>

<p>Similarly, if we have a commuting diagram of spaces</p>

\[\begin{CD}
Y @&gt;f&gt;&gt; X \\
@VVhV @| \\
Z @&gt;g&gt;&gt; X
\end{CD}\]

<p>then composing with \(p\colon X \to \mathsf{D}\) yields a commuting map of stacks,
i.e. a map between the bundles \(\psi(f)\) and \(\psi(g)\).
This map is (isomorphic to) \(\tilde h\colon f^*\mathcal{G}_1 \to g^*\mathcal{G}_1\).
Therefore the full subcategory of \(\mathsf{B}\mathcal{G}\)
spanned by the bundles which have global sections is in the image of \(\psi\).</p>

<p>Now suppose \(E\) is a principal \(\mathcal{G}\)-bundle over a space \(Y\).
Then \(Y\) has an open cover \(\mathcal{U} = \{U_i\}_{i\in I}\)
with the property that each \(\iota_i^*E\) has a global section.
The pullbacks of intersections define a descent datum for this open cover,
which lives in the image of \(\psi\).
Thus since \(\mathsf{D}\) is a stack, the descent datum is effective,
giving us an element \(\xi\) of \(\mathsf{D}\).
By functoriality of \(\mathsf{D}\) and since isomorphisms form a sheaf,
we conclude that \(\psi(\xi)\) is isomorphic to \(E\),
showing that \(\psi\) is essentially surjective.</p>

<p>Let us remark that atlases are super not unique,
but that if we have two atlases \(p\colon X \to \mathsf{D}\) and \(q\colon Y \to \mathsf{D}\)
we can construct a bibundle \(P = X\times_{\mathsf{D}} Y\)
which is principal for both resulting groupoids.
Therefore the bibundle is invertible.
Put another way, the groupoids are equivalent.</p>
