      <h1>You Can Shoot Me</h1>
<p>01 Jun 2022</p>

<p>“This I promise:” writes Ravi Vakil in the first chapter of
his notes on algebraic geometry,
“if I use the word ‘topoi’, you can shoot me.”
I guess you can shoot me,
because the purpose of this post is to cement
for myself
what on earth a topos is and why I should care about them.</p>

<p>You might be wondering how we got here.
Me too, as it happens.
I’ve been playing around with topological stacks
since the big push a couple weeks ago.
In order to write down some homotopy theory for stacks
(following <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0503247">Noohi</a>, roughly)
I wanted to know some basic categorical constructions for topological stacks.
Something I noticed (I wrote “pretty quickly”, but it’s been A Ride)
was that I was unable to prove that an infinite product of topological stacks was again topological.
This is mildly embarrassing because the category of topological spaces
certainly has all products,
and you <em>need</em> arbitrary (small, of course always small) 
products in order to prove the existence of arbitrary limits.</p>

<p>Anyway, somehow right around then I discovered the thesis of <a href="https://math.gmu.edu/~dcarched/Thesis_David_Carchedi.pdf">David Carchedi</a>,
which solves two problems with the category of topological stacks in one fell swoop.
The former problem is the lack of products already alluded to.
The existence of these together with 2-fiber products
implies the existence of all (small, of course always small) 2- or weak limits.</p>

<h2 id="convenience-of-categories">Convenience of categories</h2>

<p>The other problem it solves is the following:
a category \(\mathsf{C}\) with (binary) products is called <em>cartesian closed</em>
if for any pair of objects \(c\) and \(d\) in \(\mathsf{C}\),
there is <em>mapping object</em> \([c,d]\) or \(d^c\) with the property that for all \(e \in \mathsf{C}\),
we have an isomorphism</p>

\[\mathsf{C}(e,d^c) \cong \mathsf{C}(e\times c,d)\]

<p>which is natural in all three variables.</p>

<p>Given a pair of spaces \(X\) and \(Y\), (say Hausdorff because I always think about Hausdorff spaces)
one can always form a space \(Y^X\) whose points are maps \(X \to Y\)
given the compact–open topology
(we love the compact–open topology around here; maybe it deserves its own post someday).
The problem is that the natural isomorphism above may not exist.</p>

<p>One classical solution, usually attributed to Steenrod,
is to forget about <em>all</em> topological spaces and instead focus on the <em>compactly generated (Hausdorff)</em> spaces,
see the <a href="/2022/06/01/Adjoints.html">last post</a> for more about them.
In fact, braver souls than I impose only a <em>weak</em> Hausdorff condition.
It turns out that when \(X\) and \(Y\) are compactly generated,
\(k(Y^X)\) satisfies the natural isomorphism,
where we have to remember that \(X \times Z\) in \(\mathsf{CGHaus}\) is \(k(X\times Z)\).</p>
