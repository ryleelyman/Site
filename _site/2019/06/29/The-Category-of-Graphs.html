      <h1>The Category Of Graphs</h1>
<p>29 Jun 2019</p>

<p>You know the sensation where a familiar word becomes suddenly
completely <em>strange</em> for no apparent reason? Like suddenly the scales
fall away from your eyes and you see how utterly weird it is that a
concept has a particular name? I’ve been having that feeling with the
word <em>graph</em> as I use it in math.</p>

<p>As a kid, you learn how to <em>graph</em> simple functions in the sense of 
being able to sketch them on a sheet of, say, <em>graph</em> paper. Millions
of adults probably faintly remember the shape of <script type="math/tex">y = x^2</script> but aren’t
quite sure why.</p>

<p>To mathematicians and computer scientists, though, for some reason <em>graph</em>
means something similar, but different: to them a graph is an object with
<em>vertices</em> and <em>edges</em>. Indeed, to Serre, that’s literally all a graph is:
a quadruple <script type="math/tex">(V,E,\bar{},\iota)</script>. Two sets, <script type="math/tex">V</script> and <script type="math/tex">E</script>, represent the
vertices and (oriented) edges of the graph, and <script type="math/tex">\bar{}\colon E \to E</script> and
<script type="math/tex">\iota\colon E \to V</script> are functions; <script type="math/tex">\bar{e}</script> is the edge <script type="math/tex">e</script> with its
orientation reversed, (so <script type="math/tex">\bar{\bar{e}} = e</script> for any edge <script type="math/tex">e</script>, but
<script type="math/tex">\bar e \neq e</script>), and
<script type="math/tex">\iota(e)</script> represents the initial vertex of the edge <script type="math/tex">e</script>. This lets us
define a function <script type="math/tex">\tau\colon E \to V</script> picking out the <em>terminal</em> vertex
of an edge by setting <script type="math/tex">\tau(e) = \iota(\bar{e})</script>.</p>

<p>A topologist would prefer to say that a graph is a 1-dimensional CW complex.
So rather than an abstract set of vertices, we have a set of points, <script type="math/tex">V</script>,
the <script type="math/tex">0</script>-cells of our CW complex. And rather than an abstract set of oriented
edges, we have a collection of <script type="math/tex">1</script>-cells (intervals of the real line) 
whose endpoints are attached to <script type="math/tex">0</script>-cells.</p>

<p>These two descriptions really are in agreement for most purposes. Maybe one would
prefer the more combinatorial description as a way of “rigidifying” some of the
inherent floppiness of topological spaces. At the same time, using topological methods
allows one access to a whole host of techniques that a too-rigid approach might bury
under a sea of formalism.</p>

<p>But of course, neither definition really squares with the idea of the graph of
<script type="math/tex">y = x^2</script>, hence why I’ve been feeling weird about the word.</p>

<p>Anyway, the <em>category of graphs</em>, introduced by John Stallings in
<a href="https://www2.math.ou.edu/~nbrady/teaching/s11-5863/stallings.pdf">Topology of Finite Graphs</a>,
building on work of Serre in <a href="https://d-nb.info/965816907/04">Trees</a>, more about which
almost certainly soon, has (as all categories do)
collections of objects and arrows between them.
Here the objects are graphs and arrows are <em>morphisms of graphs.</em> 
A morphism <script type="math/tex">f\colon G \to H</script> between
graphs <script type="math/tex">G</script> and <script type="math/tex">H</script> is a pair of functions <script type="math/tex">f_V\colon V(G) \to V(H)</script> 
and <script type="math/tex">f_E\colon E(G) \to E(H)</script>, such that the following diagrams commute:
<script type="math/tex">\require{AMScd}</script></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{CD}
E(G) @>f_E>> E(H) \\
@V{\iota}VV @V{\iota}VV \\
V(G) @>f_V>> V(H)
\end{CD}\qquad
\begin{CD}
E(G) @>f_E>> E(H) \\
@V\bar{}VV @V\bar{}VV \\
E(G) @>f_E>> E(H)
\end{CD}</script>

<p>In English what this is saying is that <script type="math/tex">f</script> preserves the graph structure:
it sends edges to edges, vertices to vertices, <script type="math/tex">e</script> and <script type="math/tex">\bar e</script> are sent
to <script type="math/tex">f(e)</script> and <script type="math/tex">\overline{f(e)}</script>, and the initial vertex of <script type="math/tex">e</script> is
sent to the initial vertex of <script type="math/tex">f(e)</script>.</p>

<p>Stallings emphasizes the rigidity of morphisms in this construction:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By graph and map of graphs, I mean something purely combinatorial or
algebraic. Pictures can be drawn, but one has to understand that maps are
rigid and not just continuous, maps do not collapse edges or wrap edges
around several edges.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And it’s true; it’s a little challenging to describe precisely which
topological maps between graphs are even homotopic to morphisms without
giving the game (Stallings’ paper) away too quickly!</p>
