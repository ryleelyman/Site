<h2 id="geometric-group-theory-without-boundaries">Geometric Group Theory without Boundaries</h2>

<p>Along with Macarena Arenas, Sami Douba and Abdul Zalloum,
I am organizing a virtual “summer school” that will run the last two weeks of July.
More info is available on the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ggtwb/home?authuser=0">summer school website</a>.</p>

<p>I am giving three lectures in this summer school on Bass and Serre’s theory 
of graphs of groups and groups acting on trees.</p>

<p>Here are notes (with the annotations I added live)
for the first lecture in <a href="/assets/pdfs/GGTWB1.pdf">PDF</a> and <a href="/assets/pdfs/GGTWB1.note">Notability</a> formats.
A recording of the first lecture is on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-x5g2p0u3s">YouTube</a>.</p>

<p>Here are notes (with the annotations I added live)
for the second lecture in <a href="/assets/pdfs/GGTWB2.pdf">PDF</a> and <a href="/assets/pdfs/GGTWB2.note">Notability</a> formats.
A recording of the second lecture is on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opilmxidthY">YouTube</a>.</p>

<p>Here are notes
for the third and final lecture in <a href="/assets/pdfs/GGTWB3.pdf">PDF</a> and <a href="/assets/pdfs/GGTWB3.note">Notability</a> formats.</p>

<em>PhD thesis</em>. Available at: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00164">arXiv:2005.00164</a><br />
Abstract:
    <blockquote>
      <p>Stallings remarked that an outer automorphism of a free group
may be thought of as a subdivision of a graph followed by a sequence of folds.
In this thesis, we prove that automorphisms of fundamental groups of graphs of groups
satisfying this condition may be represented by irreducible train track maps
in the sense of Bestvina–Handel (we allow collapsing invariant subgraphs).
Of course, we construct relative train track maps as well.
Along the way, we give a new exposition of the Bass–Serre theory of groups acting on trees,
morphisms of graphs of groups, and foldings thereof.
We produce normal forms for automorphisms of free products and extend an argument
of Qing–Rafi to show that they are not quasi-geodesic.
As an application, we answer affirmatively a question of Paulin:
outer automorphisms of finitely generated word hyperbolic groups
satisfy a dynamical trichotomy generalizing the Nielsen–Thurston
“periodic, reducible of pseudo-Anosov.” At the end of the thesis
we collect some open problems we find interesting.</p>

<em>Submitted.</em> Available at: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09760">arXiv:2002.09760</a><br />
Abstract for version 3 (which is available <a href="/assets/pdfs/Nielsen_v3b.pdf">here</a>):
    <blockquote>
      <p>Given a subgroup <script type="math/tex">G</script> of the mapping class group of a surface <script type="math/tex">S</script>,
the Nielsen realization problem asks whether <script type="math/tex">G</script> can be realized
as a finite group of homeomorphisms of <script type="math/tex">S</script>. In 1983, Kerckhoff
showed that for <script type="math/tex">S</script> a finite-type surface, any finite subgroup <script type="math/tex">G</script>
may be realized as a group of isometries of some hyperbolic metric on <script type="math/tex">S</script>.
We extend Kerckhoff’s result to orientable, infinite-type surfaces.
As applications, we classify torsion elements in the mapping class group
of the plane minus a Cantor set, and also show that topological groups
containing sequences of torsion elements limiting to the identity do not
embed continuously into the mapping class group of <script type="math/tex">S</script>. Finally,
we show that compact subgroups of the mapping class group of <script type="math/tex">S</script> are finite,
and locally compact subgroups are discrete.</p>

  <li><strong>Train Tracks, Orbigraphs and CAT(0) Free-By-Cyclic Groups</strong><br />
<em>Awaiting revision.</em> Available at: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03097">arXiv:1909.03097</a><br />
Abstract:
    <blockquote>
      <p>Gersten gave an example of a polynomially-growing automorphism of <script type="math/tex">F_3</script>
whose mapping torus <script type="math/tex">F_3\rtimes\mathbb{Z}</script> cannot act properly by semi-simple
isometries on a CAT(0) metric space. By contrast, we show that if <script type="math/tex">\Phi</script>
is a polynomially-growing automorphism belonging to one of several related groups,
then there exists <script type="math/tex">k>0</script> such that the mapping torus of <script type="math/tex">\Phi^k</script> acts
properly and cocompactly on a CAT(0) metric space.
This $k$ can often be bounded uniformly.
Our results apply to automorphisms of a free product of <script type="math/tex">n</script> copies of a finite group <script type="math/tex">A</script>,
as well as to palindromic and symmetric automorphisms of a free group of finite rank.
Of independent interest, a key tool in our proof is the construction of relative train track maps
on orbigraphs, certain graphs of groups thought of as orbi-spaces.</p>
