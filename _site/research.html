<blockquote>
In this paper we develop the theory of train track maps on graphs of groups. We
prove the existence of CTs representing outer automorphisms of free products.
We generalize an index inequality due to Feighn-Handel to the graph of groups
setting, sharpening a result of Martino.

  <blockquote>
   We introduce a quantitative characterization of subgroup alternatives
   modeled on the Tits alternative
   in terms of group laws
   and investigate when this property is preserved under extensions.
   We develop a framework that lets us expand the classes of groups
   known to have locally uniform exponential growth to include
   extensions of either word hyperbolic or right-angled Artin groups
   by groups with locally uniform exponential growth.
   From this, we deduce that the automorphism group 
   of a torsion-free one-ended hyperbolic group has locally uniform exponential growth.
   Our methods also demonstrate that automorphism groups
   of torsion-free one-ended toral relatively hyperbolic groups
   and certain right-angled Artin groups satisfy our quantitative subgroup alternative.

  <li><strong>Folding-like techniques for CAT(0) cube complexes</strong><br />
 (with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/benzvi">Michael Ben-Zvi</a> and <a href="http://www.robertkropholler.com">Robert Kropholler</a>) <em>Submitted.</em> <br />

  <blockquote>
   In a seminal paper,
   Stallings introduced folding of morphisms of graphs. 
   One consequence of folding is the representation of finitely-generated subgroups 
   of a finite-rank free group as immersions of finite graphs. 
   Stallings's methods allow one to construct this representation algorithmically,
   giving effective, algorithmic answers and proofs to classical questions about subgroups of free groups. 
   Recently Dani–Levcovitz used Stallings-like methods to study subgroups of right-angled Coxeter groups,
   which act geometrically on CAT(0) cube complexes. 
   In this paper we extend their techniques to fundamental groups of non-positively curved cube complexes.

  <li><strong>Some new CAT(0) free-by-cyclic groups</strong><br />

  <blockquote>
    We show the existence
    of several new infinite families of polynomially-growing automorphisms of free groups
    whose mapping tori are CAT(0) free-by-cyclic groups.
    Such mapping tori are thick, and thus not relatively hyperbolic.
    These are the first families comprising infinitely many examples for each rank
    of the nonabelian free group;
    they contrast strongly with Gersten's example of a thick free-by-cyclic group
    which cannot be a subgroup of a CAT(0) group.

  <blockquote>
    Given a finite subgroup G of the mapping class group of a surface S,
    the Nielsen realization problem asks whether G can be realized as a 
    finite group of homeomorphisms of S.
    In 1983, Kerckhoff showed that for S a finite-type surface, any finite subgroup G
    may be realized as a group of isometries of some hyperbolic metric on S.
    We extend Kerckhoff's result to orientable, infinite-type surfaces.
    As applications, we classify torsion elements in the mapping class group of a plane minus a Cantor set,
    and also show that topological groups containing sequences of torsion elements limiting to the identity
    do not embed continuously into the mapping class group of S.
    Finally, we show that compact subgroups of the mapping class group of S are finite,
    and locally compact subgroups are discrete.

  <li><strong>Train Tracks on Graphs of Groups and Outer Automorphisms of Hyperbolic Groups</strong><br />
 <em>PhD Thesis.</em> Available at: <a href="http:///arxiv.org/abs/2005.00164">arXiv:2005.00164</a>.<br />

    <blockquote>
      Stallings remarked that an outer automorphism of a free group
      may be thought of as a subdivision of a graph followed by a sequence of folds.
      In this thesis, we prove that automorphisms of fundamental groups of graphs of groups
      satisfying this condition may be represented by irrreducible train track maps
      in the sense of Bestvina–Handel (we allow collapsing invariant subgraphs).
      Of course, we construct relative train track maps as well.
      Along the way, we give a new exposition of the Bass–Serre theory of groups acting on trees,
      morphisms of graphs of groups, and foldings thereof.
      We produce normal forms for automorphisms of free products and extend an argument
      of Qing–Rafi to show that they are not quasi-geodesic.
      As an application, we answer affirmatively a question of Paulin:
      outer automorphisms of finitely generated word hyperbolic groups
      satisfy a dynamical trichotomy generalizing the Nielsen–Thurston
      "periodic, reducible or pseudo-Anosov."
      At the end of the thesis we collect some open problems we find interesting.
