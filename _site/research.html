  <li><strong>Some new CAT(0) free-by-cyclic groups</strong><br />
<em>Accepted.</em> Available at <a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/1909.03097">arXiv:1909.03097</a>.<br />
Abstract:
    <blockquote>
      <p>We show the existence
of several new infinite families of polynomially-growing automorphisms of free groups
whose mapping tori are CAT(0) free-by-cyclic groups.
Such mapping tori are thick, and thus not relatively hyperbolic.
These are the first families comprising infinitely many examples for each rank
of the nonabelian free group;
they contrast strongly with Gersten’s example of a thick free-by-cyclic group
which cannot be a subgroup of a CAT(0) group.</p>

  <li><strong>Nielsen realization for infinite-type surfaces</strong><br />
(with <a href="http://people.math.gatech.edu/~safton3/">Santana Afton</a>, <a href="http://math.uchicago.edu/~dannyc/">Danny Calegari</a> and <a href="http://math.uchicago.edu/~lzchen/">Lvzhou Chen</a>)
<em>Accepted.</em> Available at: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/20002.09760">arXiv:2002.09760</a>.<br />
Abstract:
    <blockquote>
      <p>Given a finite subgroup \(G\) of the mapping class group of a surface \(S\),
the Nielsen realization problem asks whether \(G\) can be realized as a 
finite group of homeomorphisms of \(S\).
In 1983, Kerckhoff showed that for \(S\) a finite-type surface, any finite subgroup \(G\)
may be realized as a group of isometries of some hyperbolic metric on \(S\).
We extend Kerckhoff’s result to orientable, infinite-type surfaces.
As applications, we classify torsion elements in the mapping class group of a plane minus a Cantor set,
and also show that topological groups containing sequences of torsion elements limiting to the identity
do not embed continuously into the mapping class group of \(S\).
Finally, we show that compact subgroups of the mapping class group of \(S\) are finite,
and locally compact subgroups are discrete.</p>

  <li><strong>Train Tracks on Graphs of Groups and Outer Automorphisms of Hyperbolic Groups</strong><br />
 <em>PhD Thesis.</em> Available at: <a href="http:///arxiv.org/abs/2005.00164">arXiv:2005.00164</a>.<br />
 Abstract:
    <blockquote>
      <p>Stallings remarked that an outer automorphism of a free group
may be thought of as a subdivision of a graph followed by a sequence of folds.
In this thesis, we prove that automorphisms of fundamental groups of graphs of groups
satisfying this condition may be represented by irrreducible train track maps
in the sense of Bestvina–Handel (we allow collapsing invariant subgraphs).
Of course, we construct relative train track maps as well.
Along the way, we give a new exposition of the Bass–Serre theory of groups acting on trees,
morphisms of graphs of groups, and foldings thereof.
We produce normal forms for automorphisms of free products and extend an argument
of Qing–Rafi to show that they are not quasi-geodesic.
As an application, we answer affirmatively a question of Paulin:
outer automorphisms of finitely generated word hyperbolic groups
satisfy a dynamical trichotomy generalizing the Nielsen–Thurston
“periodic, reducible or pseudo-Anosov.”
At the end of the thesis we collect some open problems we find interesting.</p>
