      <h1>Two Approaches To The Cotangent Space</h1>
<p>10 Jul 2020</p>

<p>There is a “sheaf-theoretic” definition of something like a <em>cotangent space at a point</em>
for a locally-ringed space.
In the case of the sheaf of differentiable functions on a smooth manifold,
the two definitions—sheaf-theoretic and the usual one in differential geometry—agree.
What’s more, modulo the appropriate background technology in both subjects,
the proof is beautiful and simple—I feel like shouting it from the rooftops
at the moment, so this blog post will try and give a little exposition.
I’ll try to move briskly without assuming total familiarity with either side of things.</p>

<h2 id="the-algebraic-cotangent-space">The Algebraic Cotangent Space</h2>

<p>Let <script type="math/tex">X</script> be a smooth manifold of dimension <script type="math/tex">n</script>.
The <em>sheaf</em> of differentiable functions on <script type="math/tex">X</script> is a
contravariant functor from the category of open subsets of <script type="math/tex">X</script> to the category of rings
that assigns to an open set <script type="math/tex">U</script>
the ring <script type="math/tex">\mathscr{O}(U)</script> of differentiable functions <script type="math/tex">f\colon U \to \mathbb{R}</script>—addition
and multiplication in <script type="math/tex">\mathscr{O}(U)</script> are done pointwise in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}</script>.</p>

<p>The sheaf is not so important for us;
what we are interested in today are the <em>stalks.</em>
The idea is that elements of the <em>stalk,</em>
called <em>germs,</em> capture the “infinitesimal behavior”
of smooth functions at a point.
Here is the formal definition.
Given a point <script type="math/tex">p \in X</script>, 
the <em>stalk</em> of <em>germs</em> of smooth functions at <script type="math/tex">p</script> is the ring</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathscr{O}_p = \{(f,U) : f \in \mathscr{O}(U),\ p\in U \}/\sim.</script>

<p>The equivalence relation <script type="math/tex">\sim</script> is defined as follows:
we say <script type="math/tex">(f,U) \sim (g,V)</script> if there exists an open neighborhood
<script type="math/tex">U' \subset U \cap V</script> such that <script type="math/tex">f|_{U'} = g|_{U'}</script>.
The equivalence class of <script type="math/tex">(f,U)</script> is its <em>germ.</em>
The ring <script type="math/tex">\mathscr{O}_p</script> is the direct limit of the <script type="math/tex">\mathscr{O}(U)</script>
as <script type="math/tex">U</script> varies over the open neighborhoods of <script type="math/tex">p</script>.</p>

<p>Notice that there is a surjection <script type="math/tex">\mathscr{O}_p \to \mathbb{R}</script>
that sends the germ of <script type="math/tex">f</script> at <script type="math/tex">p</script> to <script type="math/tex">f(p)\in \mathbb{R}</script>.
The definition is independent of the choice of representative <script type="math/tex">f</script>.
Since <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}</script> is a field, the kernel of the map
is a maximal ideal; let’s call it <script type="math/tex">\mathfrak{m}_p</script>.
Observe that 
<script type="math/tex">\mathfrak{m}_p/\mathfrak{m}_p^2</script> is a module over
<script type="math/tex">\mathscr{O}_p/\mathfrak{m}_p \cong \mathbb{R}</script>, 
i.e. a real vector space;
we will call it the <em>algebraic cotangent space at <script type="math/tex">p</script>.</em></p>

<h2 id="the-usual-cotangent-space">The Usual Cotangent Space</h2>

<p>We retain our manifold <script type="math/tex">X</script> and point <script type="math/tex">p</script> from the previous section.
The <em>tangent space at <script type="math/tex">p</script>,</em> denoted <script type="math/tex">T_pX</script>
can be thought of as the space of “directions” in <script type="math/tex">X</script> at <script type="math/tex">p</script>.
This is made precise by defining it to be the space of
directional <em>derivatives</em> at <script type="math/tex">p</script>.
I won’t attempt to make this more precise, except to note that
after we choose local coordinates <script type="math/tex">(x_1,\dotsc,x_n)</script> near <script type="math/tex">p = (p_1,\dotsc,p_n)</script>,
a basis for <script type="math/tex">T_pX</script> is given by</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}\bigg|_p,\dotsc, \frac{\partial}{\partial x_n}\bigg|_p.</script>

<p>The <em>cotangent space,</em> which we are more interested in, is the
<em>dual</em> of the tangent space and is denoted <script type="math/tex">T_p^\ast X</script>.
Elements of the cotangent space are <em>linear functionals</em> on tangent vectors.
Given coordinates <script type="math/tex">x_1,\dotsc,x_n</script>,
the <em>dual basis</em> of the cotangent space is given by</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">dx_1,\dotsc, dx_n,</script>

<p>so we have <script type="math/tex">dx_i\left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}|_p\right)</script> equal to <script type="math/tex">1</script>
when <script type="math/tex">i = j</script> and equal to <script type="math/tex">0</script> otherwise.
(There perhaps ought to be some notational inclusion of the point <script type="math/tex">p</script>,
but we will suppress this.)</p>

<h2 id="the-algebraic-cotangent-space-agrees-with-the-usual-one">The Algebraic Cotangent Space Agrees With the Usual One</h2>

<p>If <script type="math/tex">f</script> is a smooth function on an open neighborhood of <script type="math/tex">p</script>
satisfying <script type="math/tex">f(p) = 0</script>,
abusing notation, we shall write the corresponding element of
<script type="math/tex">\mathfrak{m}_p/\mathfrak{m}_p^2</script>
as <script type="math/tex">f + \mathfrak{m}_p^2</script>.
Given such an element,
I claim we can interpret <script type="math/tex">f</script> as a linear functional on tangent vectors at <script type="math/tex">p</script>
by sending a tangent vector <script type="math/tex">v</script> to the value of the derivative of <script type="math/tex">f</script> at <script type="math/tex">p</script> in the direction <script type="math/tex">v</script>.
For instance, in local coordinates <script type="math/tex">(x_1,\dotsc,x_n)</script>,
the vector <script type="math/tex">\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}|_p</script> is sent to <script type="math/tex">\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(p)</script>.
Extending linearly defines a linear functional on <script type="math/tex">T_pX</script>,
which we shall denote <script type="math/tex">df_p</script>.
The value of the directional derivative of a function depends only on its germ
essentially by definition,
and the product rule from calculus tells us that the assignment
<script type="math/tex">f \mapsto df_p</script> sends elements of <script type="math/tex">\mathfrak{m}_p^2</script> to the zero functional.
The linearity of the derivative implies that <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}</script>-linear combinations
of germs are sent to <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}</script>-linear combinations of functionals,
so the assignment</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f + \mathfrak{m}_p^2 \mapsto df_p</script>

<p>really defines a map <script type="math/tex">\mathfrak{m}_p/\mathfrak{m}_p^2 \to T_p^\ast X</script>.</p>

<p>We claim this map is an isomorphism, for which it suffices to define an inverse.
Choose local coordinates <script type="math/tex">\vec x = (x_1,\dotsc,x_n)</script> around <script type="math/tex">\vec p = (p_1,\dotsc,p_n)</script>.
A general element <script type="math/tex">\alpha</script> of <script type="math/tex">T_p^\ast X</script>
may be written as the linear combination
<script type="math/tex">\alpha = a_1\mathop{dx_1} + \dotsb + a_n\mathop{dx_n}.</script>
Write <script type="math/tex">\vec a = (a_1,\dotsc,a_n)</script>.
The function <script type="math/tex">f_\alpha</script> defined as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f_\alpha(\vec x) = \vec a\cdot(\vec x - \vec p)</script>

<p>clearly has germ belonging to <script type="math/tex">\mathfrak{m}_p</script>,
and tracing the double composition,
we see that we have <script type="math/tex">a \mapsto f_\alpha + \mathfrak{m}_p^2 \mapsto d(f_\alpha)_p = \alpha</script>.
This map will be an isomorphism as soon as we can show that the germ of
<script type="math/tex">f - f_{df_p}</script> belongs to <script type="math/tex">\mathfrak{m}_p^2</script>, i.e.
can be written as <script type="math/tex">g_1h_1 + \dotsb g_kh_k</script> for some
smooth functions <script type="math/tex">g_i</script> and <script type="math/tex">h_i</script> whose germs belong to <script type="math/tex">\mathfrak{m}_p</script>.
This is the statement of Taylor’s theorem!</p>

<p>Even better, the map <script type="math/tex">\mathfrak{m}_p/\mathfrak{m}_p^2 \to T_p^\ast X</script>
is a <em>natural isomorphism,</em> in the sense that given a smooth map
<script type="math/tex">\varphi\colon X \to Y</script> of smooth manifolds such that
<script type="math/tex">\varphi(p) = q</script>, the following diagram commutes</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\require{AMScd}
	\begin{CD}
		\mathfrak{m}_q/\mathfrak{m}_q^2 @>{\cong}>> T_q^\ast Y \\
		@VV{\varphi^\ast}V @VV{\varphi^\ast}V \\
		\mathfrak{m}_p/\mathfrak{m}_p^2 @>{\cong}>> T_p^\ast X.
	\end{CD}</script>

<p>To verify this, we shall follow an element <script type="math/tex">f + \mathfrak{m}_q^2</script>
around the diagram</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{CD}
		f + \mathfrak{m}^2_q @>>> df_q \\
		@VVV @VVV \\
		f\varphi + \mathfrak{m}_p^2 @>>> d(f\varphi)_p = \mathop{df_q}\mathop{d\varphi_p},
	\end{CD}</script>

<p>and the fact that equality holds is the multi-variable chain rule!</p>

<p>Having exploited our knowledge of undegraduate calculus to prove a satisfying
natural isomorphism,
I’ll leave you with one final reason this proof excites me.
If we had wanted to, we could have replaced “differentiable” with “continuous”
in our definition of the algebraic cotangent space,
and we would still end up with a real vector space associated to every stalk.
In some sense, I guessed that this says that the only reason one never speaks of a (co)tangent
space associated to a point in a general topological space is that
there’s no reason—like Taylor’s theorem—for the space to be finite-dimensional!</p>

<p>Actually, the truth is slightly more subtle:
every continuous function has a continuous “square root” in the sense
that we can always write <script type="math/tex">f(x) = \operatorname{sgn}(f(x))\sqrt{f(x)}\sqrt{f(x)}</script>,
and the functions <script type="math/tex">\sqrt{f}</script> and <script type="math/tex">\operatorname{sgn}(f)\sqrt(f)</script> are continuous.
Therefore it is <script type="math/tex">\mathfrak{m}_p</script> that is infinite-dimensional,
while <script type="math/tex">\mathfrak{m}_p/\mathfrak{m}_p^2 = 0</script>.
