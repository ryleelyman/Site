      <h1>A Sheafy Adjunction</h1>
<p>26 Jul 2020</p>

<p>Given a topological space \(X\) and a continuous map \(\pi\colon X \to Y\),
there is an adjunction between the categories of sheaves on \(X\) and sheaves on \(Y\).
The adjunction is somewhat mysterious to me as I begin to write this,
so the hope is that by writing about it, I’ll begin to understand.</p>

<p>The functors in question are the <em>pushforward</em> and <em>inverse image</em> functors,
which arise naturally in algebraic geometry (so I am led to believe).
What makes the adjunction difficult to understand is that the definitions
of the functors in question don’t seem to play nicely with each other.</p>

<p>The proof (with a little setting the stage) appears below.
The method of proof, like most category-theoretic proofs,
is a story of careful bookkeeping with functors and natural transformations,
along with simple calculations to check.
The idea essentially seems to be that the 
unit \(\eta_\mathscr{F} \colon \mathscr{F} \to \pi_\ast\pi^{-1}\mathscr{F}\)
“shreds a section \(f\) into pieces,” while the counit
\(\epsilon_{\mathscr{G}} \colon \pi^{-1}\pi_\ast\mathscr{G} \to \mathscr{G}\)
recognizes that these “shredded up” sections assemble into sections of \(\mathscr{G}\).</p>

<h2 id="adjunctions">Adjunctions</h2>
<p>Remember, given categories \(C\) and \(D\), a pair of functors
\(F \colon C \to D\) and \(G \colon D \to C\) form an <em>adjoint pair</em>
when there exists an isomorphism</p>

\[D(Fc,d) \cong C(c,Gd)\]

<p>which is natural in \(c\) and \(d\).
We say \(F\) is <em>left adjoint</em> to \(G\),
or equivalently that \(G\) is <em>right adjoint</em> to \(F\).
In particular, setting \(d = Fc\), we have</p>

\[D(Fc,Fc) \cong C(c,GFc).\]

<p>which gives us a natural transformation \(\eta \colon 1_C \Longrightarrow GF\).
Similarly, we have \(\epsilon\colon FG \Longrightarrow 1_D\).
The natural transformation \(\eta\) is called the <em>unit</em> of the adjunction,
and \(\epsilon\) is the <em>counit.</em>
In fact, the existence of these natural transformations
could be taken to be the <em>definition</em> of an adjunction,
provided the natural transformations satisfy the identities</p>

\[\epsilon F \circ F\eta = 1_F \quad\text{and}\quad G\epsilon \circ \eta G = 1_G,\]

<p>which says that for all \(c \in C\) and \(d \in D\), the compositions</p>

\[\require{AMScd}
\begin{CD}
Fc @&gt;{F\eta_c}&gt;&gt; FGFc @&gt;{\epsilon_{Fc}}&gt;&gt; Fc
\end{CD}\]

<p>and</p>

\[\begin{CD}
Gd @&gt;{\eta_{Gd}}&gt;&gt; GFGd @&gt;{G\epsilon_d}&gt;&gt; Gd
\end{CD}\]

<p>are the identity.</p>

<p>My goal in this blog post is to show that the functors I am interested in
satisfy this latter definition of an adjunction.</p>

<h2 id="sheaves">Sheaves</h2>
<p>Given a pair of spaces \(X\) and \(Y\), and a continuous map \(\pi \colon X \to Y\),
we have functors \(\pi_\ast \colon \operatorname{Sh}_X \to \operatorname{Sh}_Y\)
and \(\pi^{-1}\colon \operatorname {Sh}_Y \to \operatorname{Sh}_X\) from the category
of sheaves on \(X\) to the category of sheaves on \(Y\) and <em>vice versa.</em>
The former is simple to describe: if \(\mathscr{G}\) is a sheaf on \(X\),
the <em>pushforward sheaf</em> \(\pi_\ast\mathscr{G}\) on \(Y\) is the assignment</p>

\[U \mapsto \mathscr{F}(\pi^{-1}(U))\]

<p>for all open subsets \(U\) of \(Y\).
If \(\psi \colon \mathscr{G} \to \mathscr{G}'\) is a morphism of sheaves on \(X\),
the morphism \(\pi_\ast\psi\) is defined by the rule</p>

\[(\pi_\ast\psi)(U) = \psi(\pi^{-1}(U)).\]

<p>The latter is slightly more complicated.
Recall that if \(\mathscr{F}\) is a sheaf on \(Y\),
there is a space \(F\) equipped with a local homeomorphism \(\rho \colon F \to Y\).
The sheaf \(\mathscr{F}\) is the sheaf of local sections of \(\rho\);
\(F\) is called the <em>espace étale</em> for the sheaf \(\mathscr{F}\).
The set of points of \(F\) above \(y \in Y\) is the <em>stalk</em> \(\mathscr{F}_y\).</p>

<p>As usual, a section \(s\colon U \to F\) of the projection \(\rho \colon F \to X\)
is an element \((s_y)_{y \in U}\) of \(\prod_{y \in U} \mathscr{F}_y\).
In our case, continuity of \(s\) is the following condition</p>

\[\begin{equation}\label{star}\tag{$\ast$}
\text{for all } y \in U, \text{ there exists an open neighborhood }
U_y \text{ of } y\\  \text{ and } f\in\mathscr{F}(U_y) \text{ such that }
f_x = s_x \text{ for all } x \in U_y.
\end{equation}\]

<p>Given that \(F\) and \(X\) admit maps to \(Y\), we can form their pullback,</p>

\[\begin{CD}
\pi^{-1}F @&gt;&gt;&gt; F \\
@VVV @VV{\rho}V \\
X @&gt;{\pi}&gt;&gt; Y
\end{CD}\]

<p>which as a set is  \(\{ (x,f_y) \in X \times F : \pi(x) = y\}\).
The topology on \(\pi^{-1}F\) is induced from the product topology on \(X \times F\).
The <em>inverse image sheaf</em> \(\pi^{-1}\mathscr{F}\) is the sheaf of sections of \(\pi^{-1}F \to X\).
The universal property of the pullback ensures that this really defines a functor
from the category of sheaves on \(Y\) to the category of sheaves on \(X\).</p>

<p>Condition \(\eqref{star}\) for continuity of a section \(s\colon V \to \pi^{-1}F\)—that is,
a tuple \((s_{\pi(x)})_{x \in V}\) in \(\prod_{x \in V}\mathscr{F}_{\pi(x)}\)—says
that for all \(x \in V\) there exists an open neighborhood \(V_x\) of \(x\)
and an open neighborhood \(U_x\) in \(Y\) such that \(\pi(V_x) \subset U_x\).
Furthermore there exists a section \(f \in \mathscr{F}(U_x)\) 
such that \(f_{\pi(v)} = s_{\pi(v)}\) for all \(v \in V_x\).</p>

<p>If \(\phi\colon \mathscr{F} \to \mathscr{F}'\) is a morphism of sheaves on \(Y\),
the resulting morphism \(\pi^{-1}\phi \colon \pi^{-1}\mathscr{F} \to \pi^{-1}\mathscr{F}'\)
is defined by</p>

\[(\pi^{-1}\phi)(V)\left[(s_{\pi(x)})_{x \in V}\right] = \left(\phi_{\pi(x)}(s_{\pi(x)})\right)_{x \in V}.\]

<p>One needs to demonstrate that the right-hand side satisfies condition \(\eqref{star}\);
the check is simple, so I’ll leave it to the reader.</p>

<p>The claim is that \(\pi^{-1}\) is left adjoint to \(\pi_\ast\).
Therefore we should expect natural transformations
\(\eta \colon 1_{\operatorname{Sh}_Y} \Longrightarrow \pi_\ast\pi^{-1}\)
and \(\epsilon \colon \pi^{-1}\pi_\ast \Longrightarrow 1_{\operatorname{Sh}_X}\).</p>

<h3 id="the-unit-of-the-adjunction">The Unit of the Adjunction</h3>

<p>So let \(\mathscr{F}\) be a sheaf on \(Y\),
and let \(U\) be an open set in \(Y\).
Since \(\pi_\ast\pi^{-1}\mathscr{F}(U) = \pi^{-1}\mathscr{F}(\pi^{-1}(U))\),
we can think of \(s \in \pi_\ast\pi^{-1}\mathscr{F}(U)\) as
a section \(s \colon \pi^{-1}(U) \to \pi^{-1}F\),
i.e. a tuple \((s_{\pi(x)})_{x \in \pi^{-1}(U)}\)
satisfying the compatibility condition above.</p>

<p>Note that in particular if \(U \subset Y\) is open
and \(f \in \mathscr{F}(U)\), the continuity condition \(\eqref{star}\)
for a section \(\pi^{-1}(U)\to \pi^{-1}F\) is satisfied by the section
\((f_{\pi(x)})_{x \in \pi^{-1}(U)}\),
and thus defines an element of \(\pi_\ast\pi^{-1}\mathscr{F}(U)\).</p>

<p>Let us thus define a map \(\eta_{\mathscr{F}}(U)\colon \mathscr{F}(U) \to \pi_\ast\pi^{-1}\mathscr{F}(U)\) 
as</p>

\[\eta_{\mathscr{F}}(U)(f) = (f_{\pi(x)})_{x\in\pi^{-1}(U)}.\]

<p>(Let’s parse the notation: a natural transformation \(\eta\) yields
a map of sheaves \(\eta_{\mathscr{F}}\) for each sheaf \(\mathscr{F}\).
This is the definition of that map on the open subset \(U \subset Y\).)</p>

<p>To prove the claim that \(\eta\) is a natural transformation,
we need to show that given a map \(\phi \colon \mathscr{F} \to \mathscr{F}'\)
of sheaves on \(Y\), the following diagram commutes</p>

\[\begin{CD}
\mathscr{F} @&gt;{\eta_{\mathscr{F}}}&gt;&gt; \pi_\ast\pi^{-1}\mathscr{F} \\
@V{\phi}VV @VV{\pi_\ast\pi^{-1}\phi}V \\
\mathscr{F}' @&gt;{\eta_{\mathscr{F}'}}&gt;&gt; \pi_\ast\pi^{-1}\mathscr{F}'.
\end{CD}\]

<p>Given \(f \in \mathscr{F}(U)\), commutativity of the square is the claim that
the following equality holds</p>

\[\left((\phi(U)(f))_{\pi(x)}\right)_{x \in \pi^{-1}(U)} 
= \left(\phi_{\pi(x)}(f_{\pi(x)})\right)_{x \in \pi^{-1}(U)}.\]

<p>This is in fact true, since taking the stalk at \(x\) is functorial.</p>

<h3 id="the-counit-of-the-adjunction">The Counit of the Adjunction</h3>

<p>Now suppose that \(\mathscr{G}\) is a sheaf on \(X\).
Let \(\pi_\ast G\) denote the <em>espace étale</em> over \(Y\) for the sheaf \(\pi_\ast\mathscr{G}\).</p>

<p>A section \(s \colon V \to \pi^{-1}\pi_\ast G\)
is a tuple \((s_{\pi(x)})_{x \in V}\) taking values in \(\pi_\ast\mathscr{G}_{\pi(x)}\)
satisfying the continuity condition \(\eqref{star}\),
which in our particular case asserts the existence,
for each \(x \in V\), of an open neighborhood \(V_x\) of \(x\) and an open neighborhood
\(U_x\) in \(Y\) satisfying \(\pi(V_x) \subset U_x\).
Furthermore there exists \(g \in \pi_\ast\mathscr{G}(U_x) = \mathscr{G}(\pi^{-1}(U_x))\)
such that the image of \(s_{\pi(x)}\) in \(\mathscr{G}_x\) under the natural map
\(\pi_\ast\mathscr{G}_{\pi(x)} \to \mathscr{G}_x\) is equal to \(g_x\).</p>

<p>Since the sets \(\pi^{-1}(U_x)\) cover \(V\) by assumption,
sheafiness of \(\mathscr{G}\) implies the existence of a unique \(g \in \mathscr{G}(V)\)
such that \(g_x\) is equal to the image of \(s_{\pi(x)}\)
under the natural map \(\pi_\ast\mathscr{G}_{\pi(x)} \to \mathscr{G}_x\)
for <em>all</em> \(x \in V\).
Let us thus define a map \(\epsilon_{\mathscr{G}}(V) \colon \pi^{-1}\pi_\ast\mathscr{G}(V) \to \mathscr{G}(V)\)
sending \((s_{\pi(x)})_{x\in V}\) to \(g\).</p>

<p>We claim that \(\epsilon\) defines a natural transformation from \(\pi^{-1}\pi_\ast\mathscr{G}\) to \(\mathscr{G}\).
To prove the claim, we need to show that given a map \(\psi\colon \mathscr{G} \to \mathscr{G}'\)
of sheaves on \(X\), the following diagram commutes</p>

\[\begin{CD}
\pi^{-1}\pi_\ast\mathscr{G} @&gt;{\epsilon_{\mathscr{G}}}&gt;&gt; \mathscr{G} \\
@V{\pi^{-1}\pi_\ast\psi}VV @VV{\psi}V \\
\pi^{-1}\pi_\ast \mathscr{G}' @&gt;{\epsilon_{\mathscr{G}'}}&gt;&gt; \mathscr{G}'.
\end{CD}\]

<p>Given \((s_{\pi(x)})_{x \in V} \in \pi^{-1}\pi_\ast\mathscr{G}(V)\),
the upper right path of the square sends us first to some \(g \in \mathscr{G}(V)\)
such that \(g_x\) is the image of \(s_{\pi(x)}\) in \(\mathscr{G}_x\) for all \(x \in V\),
and then sends \(g\) to \(\psi(V)(g) \in \mathscr{G}'(V)\).
On the other hand, the lower left path of the square sends
\((s_{\pi(x)})_{x \in V}\) first to \(\left((\pi_\ast\psi)_{\pi(x)}(s_{\pi(x)})\right)_{x \in V}\)
in \(\pi^{-1}\pi_\ast\mathscr{G}'(V)\), and then to
some \(g' \in \mathscr{G}'(V)\) such that \(g'_x\) is the image of
\((\pi_\ast\psi)_{\pi(x)}(s_{\pi(x)})\) in \(\mathscr{G}'_x\) for all \(x \in V\).</p>

<p>If \(U \subset Y\) is an open set containing \(\pi(x)\) such that
\(s \in \pi_\ast\mathscr{G}(U) = \mathscr{G}(\pi^{-1}(U))\) 
represents \(s_{\pi(x)}\) for \(\pi(x) \in U\),
we have \((\pi_\ast\psi)_{\pi(x)}(s_{\pi(x)}) = \psi(\pi^{-1}(U))(s)_{\pi(x)}\).
Furthermore we know that \(g \in \mathscr{G}(V)\) 
is such that the image of \(s_{\pi(x)}\) in \(\mathscr{G}_x\)
is \(g_x\) for all \(x \in V\).
Therefore we have that
the image of \(\psi(\pi^{-1}(U))(s)_{\pi(x)}\)
in \(\mathscr{G}'_x\) is equal to \(\psi(V)(g)_x\),
as desired.</p>

<h2 id="the-inverse-imagepushforward-adjunction">The inverse image–pushforward adjunction</h2>

<p>To conclude, we just need to show that two double compositions
of natural transformations are the identity.
The first, translated into our particular case,
says that if \(\mathscr{F}\) is a sheaf on \(Y\),
we have that</p>

\[\begin{CD}
\pi^{-1}\mathscr{F} @&gt;{\pi^{-1}\eta_{\mathscr{F}}}&gt;&gt; \pi^{-1}\pi_\ast\pi^{-1}\mathscr{F} @&gt;{\epsilon_{\pi^{-1}\mathscr{F}}}&gt;&gt;
\pi^{-1}\mathscr{F}
\end{CD}\]

<p>is equal to the identity.
The difficulty here seems to be largely notational.
Let \(V \subset X\) be an open set.
Suppose \((s_{\pi(x)})_{x \in V}\) is a section in \(\pi^{-1}\mathscr{F}(V)\).
We have</p>

\[(\pi^{-1}\eta_{\mathscr{F}})(V)\left[(s_{\pi(x)})_{x\in V}\right]
= \left((\eta_{\mathscr{F}})_{\pi(x)}(s_{\pi(x)})\right)_{x \in V}
\in \pi^{-1}\pi_\ast\pi^{-1}\mathscr{F}(V).\]

<p>First observe that the continuity condition \(\eqref{star}\) tells us that
there is, for each \(x \in V\), an open neighborhood \(V_x\) of \(x\) and
an open set \(U_x \subset Y\) containing \(\pi(V_x)\).
On this open set we have \(s \in \mathscr{F}(U_x)\) such that
\(\left((\eta_{\mathscr{F}})(U_x)(s)\right)_{\pi(x)} = (\eta_{\mathscr{F}})_{\pi(x)}(s_{\pi(x)})\).</p>

<p>We saw above that \((\eta_{\mathscr{F}})(U_x)(s)\) is the section
\((s_{\pi(x)})_{x \in \pi^{-1}(U_x)} \in \pi_\ast\pi^{-1}\mathscr{F}(U_x) = 
\pi^{-1}\mathscr{F}(\pi^{-1}(U))\).
The map \(\epsilon_{\pi^{-1}\mathscr F}\) recognizes that the sections
\((s_{\pi(x)})_{x \in \pi^{-1}(U_x)}\) satisfy the compatibility conditions
to glue up to form a section \((s_{\pi(x)})_{x \in V}\) in \(\pi^{-1}\mathscr{F}(V)\),
demonstrating that the double composition is indeed the identity. So far so good.</p>

<p>The second double composition we need to show is equal to the identity is defined 
for a sheaf \(\mathscr{G}\) on \(X\) as follows</p>

\[\begin{CD}
\pi_\ast\mathscr{G} @&gt;{\eta_{\pi_\ast\mathscr{G}}}&gt;&gt; \pi_\ast\pi^{-1}\pi_\ast\mathscr{G}
@&gt;{\pi_\ast\epsilon_{\mathscr{G}}}&gt;&gt; \pi_\ast\mathscr{G}.
\end{CD}\]

<p>If \(U \subset Y\) is an open set and \(g \in \pi_\ast\mathscr{G}(U)\)
is a section,
the first map sends \(g\) to the section
\((g_{\pi(x)})_{x \in \pi^{-1}(U)} \in \pi_\ast\pi^{-1}\pi_\ast\mathscr{G}(U)\).</p>

<p>The second map recognizes that the above section and \(g \in \mathscr{G}(\pi^{-1}(U)) = \pi_\ast\mathscr{G}\)
agree on each stalk, and so sends our section back to \(g\).</p>

<p>This completes the proof that inverse image and pushforward form an adjoint pair of functors.</p>
