[Here is my CV][CV].

## Publications and Preprints

 - **Extensions of hyperbolic groups have locally uniform exponential growth**  
(with [Robert Kropholler][Rob] and [Thomas Ng][Thomas]) *In preparation.*

 - **Folding for cube complexes**  
(with [Michael Ben-Zvi][Benzvi] and [Robert Kropholler][Rob]) *In preparation.*

 - **Some new CAT(0) free-by-cyclic groups**  
*Accepted.* Available at [arXiv:1909.03097](http://arXiv.org/abs/1909.03097).  
Abstract:
> We show the existence
> of several new infinite families of polynomially-growing automorphisms of free groups
> whose mapping tori are CAT(0) free-by-cyclic groups.
> Such mapping tori are thick, and thus not relatively hyperbolic.
> These are the first families comprising infinitely many examples for each rank
> of the nonabelian free group;
> they contrast strongly with Gersten's example of a thick free-by-cyclic group
> which cannot be a subgroup of a CAT(0) group.

 - **Nielsen realization for infinite-type surfaces**  
(with [Santana Afton][Santana], [Danny Calegari][Danny] and [Lvzhou Chen][Lvzhou])
*Accepted.* Available at: [arXiv:2002.09760](http://arxiv.org/abs/20002.09760).  
Abstract:
> Given a finite subgroup $$G$$ of the mapping class group of a surface $$S$$,
> the Nielsen realization problem asks whether $$G$$ can be realized as a 
> finite group of homeomorphisms of $$S$$.
> In 1983, Kerckhoff showed that for $$S$$ a finite-type surface, any finite subgroup $$G$$
> may be realized as a group of isometries of some hyperbolic metric on $$S$$.
> We extend Kerckhoff's result to orientable, infinite-type surfaces.
> As applications, we classify torsion elements in the mapping class group of a plane minus a Cantor set,
> and also show that topological groups containing sequences of torsion elements limiting to the identity
> do not embed continuously into the mapping class group of $$S$$.
> Finally, we show that compact subgroups of the mapping class group of $$S$$ are finite,
> and locally compact subgroups are discrete.

 - **Train Tracks on Graphs of Groups and Outer Automorphisms of Hyperbolic Groups**  
 *PhD Thesis.* Available at: [arXiv:2005.00164](http:///arxiv.org/abs/2005.00164).  
 Abstract:
 > Stallings remarked that an outer automorphism of a free group
 > may be thought of as a subdivision of a graph followed by a sequence of folds.
 > In this thesis, we prove that automorphisms of fundamental groups of graphs of groups
 > satisfying this condition may be represented by irrreducible train track maps
 > in the sense of Bestvina–Handel (we allow collapsing invariant subgraphs).
 > Of course, we construct relative train track maps as well.
 > Along the way, we give a new exposition of the Bass–Serre theory of groups acting on trees,
 > morphisms of graphs of groups, and foldings thereof.
 > We produce normal forms for automorphisms of free products and extend an argument
 > of Qing–Rafi to show that they are not quasi-geodesic.
 > As an application, we answer affirmatively a question of Paulin:
 > outer automorphisms of finitely generated word hyperbolic groups
 > satisfy a dynamical trichotomy generalizing the Nielsen–Thurston
 > "periodic, reducible or pseudo-Anosov."
 > At the end of the thesis we collect some open problems we find interesting.
