# Research 

[Here is my CV][CV].
$$\newcommand{\out}{\operatorname{Out}}$$
$$\newcommand{\cato}{\operatorname{CAT}(0)}$$

In my thesis I study outer automorphism groups of finite
free products of finite groups, $$\out(W)$$. My favorite free products
of finite groups are the free Coxeter groups $$W_n = 
\underbrace{\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} * 
\dotsb * \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}}_{n \text{ terms}}$$.

Being outer automorphism groups of
virtually-free groups, the $$\out(W)$$ are closely related to $$\out(F_n)$$,
the outer automorphism group of the free group of rank $$n$$.
But there are also some differences. For example, Gersten found a
polynomially-growing
free-by-cyclic group $$F_3\rtimes\mathbb{Z}$$ which is a "poison subgroup":
groups containing it, such as $$\out(F_4)$$, cannot be $$\cato$$ groups.
On the other hand, every polynomially-growing
$$W_n\rtimes\mathbb{Z}$$ group is virtually $$\cato$$.
This leaves open the question of whether the $$\out(W)$$ might be $$\cato$$ groups.

## Upcoming Travel

This summer, I will attend [Young Geometric Group Theory VIII][yGGT],
the IHES summer school [Aspects of Geometric Group Theory][IHES],
and the [Wasatch Topology Conference][Wasatch].

In the fall I will speak at the [SUNY Albany Algebra/Topology Seminar][Albany],
and at an [AMS Special Session on Effective and Quantitative Advances in
Low Dimensional Topology and Geometric Group Theory][AMS].
