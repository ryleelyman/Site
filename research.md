# Research 

[Here is my CV][CV].

I am interested in geometric group theory,
CAT(0) and hyperbolic geometry, and low-dimensional topology.
In my thesis I study outer automorphisms of free products of finite groups.
They have natural connections to outer automorphisms of free groups,
free-by-cyclic groups, right-angled Coxeter groups and braid groups.
I am interested in exploring all of these connections, as well as
studying the deformation theory of geometric group actions of the above groups
on CAT(0) metric spaces.

## Upcoming Travel

This fall I have spoken at the [Temple Geometry and Topology Seminar][Temple],
the [SUNY Albany Algebra/Topology Seminar][Albany],
and at an [AMS Special Session on Effective and Quantitative Advances in
Low Dimensional Topology and Geometric Group Theory][AMS].

I will be attending [Junior Geometry and Topology in the Midwest][Madison]
and [Algorithms in Complex Dynamics and Mapping Class Groups][ICERM].

In the spring I will speak at an [AMS Special Session on Combinatorial Methods
in Geometric Group Theory][AMS2].
