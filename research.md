## Geometric Group Theory without Boundaries

Along with Macarena Arenas, Sami Douba and Abdul Zalloum,
I am organizing a virtual "summer school" that will run the last two weeks of July.
More info is available on the [summer school website](https://sites.google.com/view/ggtwb/home?authuser=0).

I am giving three lectures in this summer school on Bass and Serre's theory 
of graphs of groups and groups acting on trees.

Here are notes (with the annotations I added live)
for the lectures, as well as links to recordings of the lectures.
 - Lecture 1 [PDF][Lecture1PDF], [Notability][Lecture1Note], [YouTube][Youtube1]
 - Lecture 2 [PDF][Lecture2PDF], [Notability][Lecture2Note], [YouTube][YouTube2]
 - Lecture 3 [PDF][Lecture3PDF], [Notability][Lecture3Note], [YouTube][YouTube3].
[Here][exercises] are some suggested exercises.

## Publications and Preprints

- **Doubly-Uniform Exponential Growth for Free-By-Cyclic Groups**  
(with [Robert Kropholler](http://www.robertkropholler.com) and [Thomas Ng](https://sites.google.com/site/thomasng192/))  
*In preparation.*

- **Train Tracks on Graphs of Groups and Outer Automorphisms of Hyperbolic Groups**  
*PhD thesis*. Available at: [arXiv:2005.00164](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00164)  
Abstract:  
> Stallings remarked that an outer automorphism of a free group
> may be thought of as a subdivision of a graph followed by a sequence of folds.
> In this thesis, we prove that automorphisms of fundamental groups of graphs of groups
> satisfying this condition may be represented by irreducible train track maps
> in the sense of Bestvina–Handel (we allow collapsing invariant subgraphs).
> Of course, we construct relative train track maps as well.
> Along the way, we give a new exposition of the Bass–Serre theory of groups acting on trees,
> morphisms of graphs of groups, and foldings thereof.
> We produce normal forms for automorphisms of free products and extend an argument
> of Qing–Rafi to show that they are not quasi-geodesic.
> As an application, we answer affirmatively a question of Paulin:
> outer automorphisms of finitely generated word hyperbolic groups
> satisfy a dynamical trichotomy generalizing the Nielsen–Thurston
> "periodic, reducible of pseudo-Anosov." At the end of the thesis
> we collect some open problems we find interesting.

- **Nielsen realization for infinite-type surfaces**  
(with [Santana Afton](http://people.math.gatech.edu/~safton3/), 
[Danny Calegari](http://math.uchicago.edu/~dannyc/) and [Lvzhou Chen](http://math.uchicago.edu/~lzchen/))  
*Accepted.* Available at: [arXiv:2002.09760](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09760)  
Abstract:
> Given a subgroup $$G$$ of the mapping class group of a surface $$S$$,
> the Nielsen realization problem asks whether $$G$$ can be realized
> as a finite group of homeomorphisms of $$S$$. In 1983, Kerckhoff
> showed that for $$S$$ a finite-type surface, any finite subgroup $$G$$
> may be realized as a group of isometries of some hyperbolic metric on $$S$$.
> We extend Kerckhoff's result to orientable, infinite-type surfaces.
> As applications, we classify torsion elements in the mapping class group
> of the plane minus a Cantor set, and also show that topological groups
> containing sequences of torsion elements limiting to the identity do not
> embed continuously into the mapping class group of $$S$$. Finally,
> we show that compact subgroups of the mapping class group of $$S$$ are finite,
> and locally compact subgroups are discrete.

- **Some new CAT(0) free-by-cyclic groups**   
*Accepted.* Available at: [arXiv:1909.03097][somenewcat0freebyz]  
Abstract:  
> We show the existence
> of several new infinite families of polynomially-growing automorphisms of
> free groups whose mapping tori are CAT(0) free-by-cyclic groups. Such mapping
> tori are thick, and thus not relatively hyperbolic. These are the first
> families comprising infinitely many examples for each rank of the nonabelian
> free group; they contrast strongly with Gersten’s example of a thick
> free-by-cyclic group, which cannot be a subgroup of a CAT(0) group.
